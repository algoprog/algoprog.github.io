Most systems usually rely only on traditional sparse retrieval. This can have a significant impact on the recall, especially when the relevant passages have few overlapping words with the query sentence. In this work, we show that simple training of a dense retriever is sufficient to outperform traditional sparse representations in both question answering and fact-checking. Our model is incorporated in a real world semantic search engine that returns snippets containing evidence related to questions and claims about the COVID-19 pandemic.","tags":["passage retrieval","natural language processing","question answering"],"title":"Latent Retrieval for Large-Scale Fact-Checking and Question Answering with NLI training","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["natural language processing","machine learning"],"content":"","date":1496322624,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496322624,"objectID":"03b78016a6af909b2e78ad70d01989c5","permalink":"https://algoprog.com/project/wamby/","publishdate":"2017-06-01T21:10:24+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/wamby/","section":"project","summary":"Web based open domain question answering system that extracts answers from the top k results of Google.","tags":["natural language processing","machine learning"],"title":"Wamby","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":["artificial intelligence","tools"],"content":"","date":1439644412,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1439644412,"objectID":"4fab69d8d483af8aaba775aa7fa9b42d","permalink":"https://algoprog.com/project/laby/","publishdate":"2015-08-15T21:13:32+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/laby/","section":"project","summary":"Maze generator, editor \u0026 solver in Java.","tags":["artificial intelligence","tools"],"title":"Laby","type":"project"}]
