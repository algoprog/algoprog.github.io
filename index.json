Large noisy document collections like the web or news articles make the task more difficult. We examine the performance of a three-stage automated fact-checking system using various evidence retrieval and selection methods. We demonstrate that hybrid passage retrieval using sparse and dense representations leads to much higher evidence recall in a noisy setting. We also propose two sentence selection approaches, an embedding-based selection using a dense retrieval model, and a sequence labeling approach for context-aware selection. The embedding-based selection achieves very high recall across two different datasets, while the sequence labeling model achieves higher precision and improves the verification accuracy compared to context-agnostic sentence selection approaches. Using the same three-stage architecture, we built Quin, a large-scale fact-checking system for the COVID-19 pandemic.","tags":["passage retrieval","natural language processing","fact-checking"],"title":"Improving Evidence Retrieval for Automated Explainable Fact-Checking","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["natural language processing","machine learning"],"content":"","date":1597496526,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597496526,"objectID":"ddd8617bd571e1216ee10b819606b055","permalink":"https://algoprog.com/project/quin/","publishdate":"2020-08-15T21:02:06+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/quin/","section":"project","summary":"An easy to use framework for scalable semantic search.","tags":["natural language processing","machine learning"],"title":"Quin","type":"project"},{"authors":["Chris Samarinas","Wynne Hsu","Mong Li Lee"],"categories":["natural language processing","question answering"],"content":"","date":1594813972,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594813972,"objectID":"c7a29a0318f895139ebd4eeb96153529","permalink":"https://algoprog.com/publication/latent-retrieval-fact-checking-question-answering-nli/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T19:52:52+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/latent-retrieval-fact-checking-question-answering-nli/","section":"publication","summary":"Passage retrieval is a part of fact-checking and question answering systems that is critical yet often neglected. Most systems usually rely only on traditional sparse retrieval. This can have a significant impact on the recall, especially when the relevant passages have few overlapping words with the query sentence. In this work, we show that simple training of a dense retriever is sufficient to outperform traditional sparse representations in both question answering and fact-checking. Our model is incorporated in a real world semantic search engine that returns snippets containing evidence related to questions and claims about the COVID-19 pandemic.","tags":["passage retrieval","natural language processing","question answering"],"title":"Latent Retrieval for Large-Scale Fact-Checking and Question Answering with NLI training","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r[18/03/21] Our demo paper on evidence retrieval for fact-checking was accepted at NAACL 2021.\n[12/02/21] In September 2021, I will join the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval at University of Massachusetts Amherst, the top department in Information Retrieval, for a MSc/PhD in Computer Science.\n[03/09/20] Our paper on latent retrieval for fact-checking and QA was accepted as a long paper at IEEE ICTAI 2020.\n[31/08/20] NUS President Professor Tan Eng Chye launched our LetsCheck platform.\n","date":1512057600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512057600,"objectID":"a0812ae5f3c926fea6faf4472cefc8e2","permalink":"https://algoprog.com/news/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/news/","section":"","summary":"\r\nList of news.\r\n","tags":[],"title":"News","type":"page"},{"authors":[],"categories":["natural language processing","machine learning"],"content":"","date":1496322624,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496322624,"objectID":"03b78016a6af909b2e78ad70d01989c5","permalink":"https://algoprog.com/project/wamby/","publishdate":"2017-06-01T21:10:24+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/wamby/","section":"project","summary":"Web based open domain question answering system that extracts answers from the top k results of Google.","tags":["natural language processing","machine learning"],"title":"Wamby","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":["artificial intelligence","tools"],"content":"","date":1439644412,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1439644412,"objectID":"4fab69d8d483af8aaba775aa7fa9b42d","permalink":"https://algoprog.com/project/laby/","publishdate":"2015-08-15T21:13:32+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/laby/","section":"project","summary":"Maze generator, editor \u0026 solver in Java.","tags":["artificial intelligence","tools"],"title":"Laby","type":"project"}]
