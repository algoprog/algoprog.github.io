Large noisy document collections like the web or news articles make the task more difficult. We examine the performance of a three-stage automated fact-checking system using various evidence retrieval and selection methods. We demonstrate that hybrid passage retrieval using sparse and dense representations leads to much higher evidence recall in a noisy setting. We also propose two sentence selection approaches, an embedding-based selection using a dense retrieval model, and a sequence labeling approach for context-aware selection. The embedding-based selection achieves very high recall across two different datasets, while the sequence labeling model achieves higher precision and improves the verification accuracy compared to context-agnostic sentence selection approaches. Using the same three-stage architecture, we built Quin, a large-scale fact-checking system for the COVID-19 pandemic.","tags":["passage retrieval","natural language processing","fact-checking"],"title":"Improving Evidence Retrieval for Automated Explainable Fact-Checking","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1599067920,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599067920,"objectID":"1a1c1b1f3039986019777fc41762e523","permalink":"https://algoprog.com/talk/ictai-2020-paper-accepted/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T20:44:33+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/ictai-2020-paper-accepted/","section":"talk","summary":"Our paper on latent retrieval for fact-checking and QA was accepted as a long paper at ICTAI 2020.","tags":[],"title":"One Paper Accepted at IEEE ICTAI 2020","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598857200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598857200,"objectID":"2be61bf65923f5ae197cea6daae1257c","permalink":"https://algoprog.com/talk/letscheck-platform-launch/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T20:14:20+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/letscheck-platform-launch/","section":"talk","summary":"NUS President Professor Tan Eng Chye launched our LetsCheck platform.","tags":[],"title":"Letscheck Platform Launch","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":["natural language processing","machine learning"],"content":"","date":1597496526,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597496526,"objectID":"ddd8617bd571e1216ee10b819606b055","permalink":"https://algoprog.com/project/quin/","publishdate":"2020-08-15T21:02:06+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/quin/","section":"project","summary":"An easy to use framework for scalable semantic search.","tags":["natural language processing","machine learning"],"title":"Quin","type":"project"},{"authors":["Chris Samarinas","Wynne Hsu","Mong Li Lee"],"categories":["natural language processing","question answering"],"content":"","date":1594813972,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594813972,"objectID":"c7a29a0318f895139ebd4eeb96153529","permalink":"https://algoprog.com/publication/latent-retrieval-fact-checking-question-answering-nli/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T19:52:52+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/latent-retrieval-fact-checking-question-answering-nli/","section":"publication","summary":"Passage retrieval is a part of fact-checking and question answering systems that is critical yet often neglected. Most systems usually rely only on traditional sparse retrieval. This can have a significant impact on the recall, especially when the relevant passages have few overlapping words with the query sentence. In this work, we show that simple training of a dense retriever is sufficient to outperform traditional sparse representations in both question answering and fact-checking. Our model is incorporated in a real world semantic search engine that returns snippets containing evidence related to questions and claims about the COVID-19 pandemic.","tags":["passage retrieval","natural language processing","question answering"],"title":"Latent Retrieval for Large-Scale Fact-Checking and Question Answering with NLI training","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["natural language processing","machine learning"],"content":"","date":1496322624,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496322624,"objectID":"03b78016a6af909b2e78ad70d01989c5","permalink":"https://algoprog.com/project/wamby/","publishdate":"2017-06-01T21:10:24+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/wamby/","section":"project","summary":"Web based open domain question answering system that extracts answers from the top k results of Google.","tags":["natural language processing","machine learning"],"title":"Wamby","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":["artificial intelligence","tools"],"content":"","date":1439644412,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1439644412,"objectID":"4fab69d8d483af8aaba775aa7fa9b42d","permalink":"https://algoprog.com/project/laby/","publishdate":"2015-08-15T21:13:32+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/laby/","section":"project","summary":"Maze generator, editor \u0026 solver in Java.","tags":["artificial intelligence","tools"],"title":"Laby","type":"project"}]
