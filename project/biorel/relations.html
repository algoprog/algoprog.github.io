<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>[Spectral parameters of the cytochrome c and hemoglobin interaction with methanol and aniline]. At 20 degrees C, in a phosphate buffer, pH 5,8--8,0, methanol and <span class="CHEMICAL">aniline</span> interactions with hemoglobin and cytochrome c were studied using the difference spectrophotometry method. The difference absorption spectra are characterized by following values of lambdamax and lambdamin (nm): I--MeOH--hemoglobin (405 and 420), II-MeOH--cytochrome c (405--406 and 419--422), III--aniline--cytochrome c (421--410 and 401--396). The values of lambdamax and lambdamin for system III are shifted in the region of shorter wavelengths from 421 to 410 nm and from 401 to 396 nm, respectively within the pH range of 5,8--7,95. From difference spectra for systems I, <span class="GENE">II</span>, III the dissociation constants of complexes obtained, Ks were calculated. Log Ks is linearly dependent on pH. System I is characterized by two values of Ks at all pH. The Ks values were calculated in general form from the dependences obtained. The nature of the complexes is discussed.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in resistant and susceptible guinea pigs: in vivo and in vitro correlates. Strain 2 guinea pigs develop less severe experimental allergic encephalomyelitis than do strain 13 and Hartley guinea pigs when sensitized with equivalent amounts of homologous <span class="GENE">myelin basic protein</span> (BP) in complete Freund's adjuvant. In vivo and in vitro correlates of delayed hypersensitivity to <span class="GENE">myelin basic protein</span> are depressed in the strain 2 guinea pigs relative to the two susceptible strains. The incidence of circulating anti-BP antibodies is also lower in sera from strain 2 guinea pigs than in sera from strain 13 or Hartley guinea pigs. There was no difference among the three strains in their ability to mount delayed hypersensitivity to tuberculin, nor in the response of their cells to <span class="CHEMICAL">PHA</span> in vitro.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase of the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe 972h-. Changes in activity and inhibitor-sensitivity in response to catabolite repression. 1. The specific activity of mitochondrial ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase) in extracts of Schizosaccharomyces pombe decreased 2.5-fold as the <span class="CHEMICAL">glucose</span> concentration in the growth medium decreased from 50mM to 15mM. 2. During the late exponential phase of growth, ATPase activity doubled. 3. Sensitivity to oligomycin and Dio-9 as measured by values for I50(mug of inhibitor/mg of protein giving 50% inhibition) at pH 6.8 increased sixfold and ninefold respectively during the initial decrease in ATPase activity, and this degree of sensitivity was maintained for the remainder of the growth cycle. 4. Increased sensitivity to NN'-dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide, triethyltin and venturicidin was also observed during the early stage of <span class="CHEMICAL">glucose</span> de-repression. 5. Smaller increases in sensitivity to efrapeptin, aurovertin, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diaz-le, quercetin and spegazzinine also occurred. 6. The ATPase of glycerol-grown <span class="GENE">cells</span> was less sensitive to inhibitors than that of glucose-repressed cells; change in values for I50 were not so marked during the growth cycle of <span class="GENE">cells</span> growing with glycerol. 7. When submitochondrial particles from glycerol-grown <span class="GENE">cells</span> were tested by passage through Sephadex G-50, a fourfold increase in activity was accompanied by increased inhibitor resistance. 8. Gel filtration of submitochondrial particles from glucose-de-repressed <span class="GENE">cells</span> gave similar results, whereas loss of ATPase occurred in submitochondrial particles from glucose-repressed <span class="GENE">cells</span>. 9. It is proposed that alterations in sensitivity to inhibitors at different stages of <span class="CHEMICAL">glucose</span> derepression may be partly controlled by a naturally occuring inhibitor of ATPase. 10. The inhibitors tested may be classififed into two groups on the basis of alterations of sensitivity of the ATPase during physiological modification: (a) oligomycin, Dio-9, NN'-dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide, venturicidin and triethyltin, and (b) efrapeptin, aurovertin, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, quercetin and spegazzinine.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Catabolism physical, and immunologic properties of endocytosed isologous and heterologous iota-globulins by mouse macrophages. The catabolism of completely endocytosed isologous and heterologous gamma-globulins by mouse macrophages was studied in vitro. Mouse, human, and rabbit 125-I-IgG were coupled to mouse, human, or sheep erythrocytes either as antibodies or by covalent binding. They were exposed to macrophages for 1 hr and the non-endocytosed erythrocytes were then removed with a Ficoll gradient centrifugation. Catabolism was evaluated after 2, 5, and 18 hr in culture by measuring the radioactivity released into the culture medium as well as the radioactivity that remained associated with <span class="GENE">cells</span>. It was found that all iota-globulins were catabolized in a similar fashion, and that the type of carrier erythrocytes (isologous or heterologous) had no influence on catabolism. Some of the material that remained associated with macrophages was on the cell membrane and could be removed by trypsin. Some of the material that was released by macrophages was completely degraded but some was either not degraded or only partially degraded. <span class="CHEMICAL">sucrose</span> density gradient analysis and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that this material had kept some physical properties of native iota-globulins. It was also found with the antigen-binding inhibition test and incubation with erythrocytes that the released material contained molecules carrying Fab determinants and was able to bind specifically to erythrocytic antigens. Taken together, these observations show that iota-globulins phagocytosed in the form of antigen-antibody complexes are only incompletely degraded and that the material associated with plasma membrane of macrophages or found in the culture medium is a product of cell catabolism.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Immunological crossreaction between alpha-fetoprotein and albumin. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a fetal protein associated with certain tumors, and serum albumin did not corssreact immunologically in native form. Unfolding of their polypeptide chains by reduction of the disulfide bonds followed by <span class="CHEMICAL">carboxamidomethylation</span> produced derivatives with immunochemical properties different from those of the native proteins. Precipitating reactions and radioimmunoassays preformed with antibodies to such unfolded derivatives showed strong crossreactions between albumin and <span class="GENE">AFP</span>. These assays were found to lack species specificity: AFPs and albumins from different species were equally active. Several other proteins unrelated to <span class="GENE">AFP</span> or albumin did not react or reacted much less in these assays. These results support the conclusions derived from recent sequence data that <span class="GENE">AFP</span> and albumin are structurally related and have a common ancestral gene.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>[Characteristics of the phlogistic action of <span class="GENE">melittin</span>, its C-terminal fragment and some basic peptides in the rat paw (author's transl)]. Injection into the rat paw of either <span class="GENE">melittin</span>, its C-terminal dekapeptide, <span class="CHEMICAL">tetralysine</span> or triarginine causes an inflammatory response with <span class="GENE">melittin</span> having the highest and the last mentioned peptides the lowest activity. The inflammatory action of <span class="GENE">melittin</span> and the dekapeptide has the following characteristics: 1. it is mainly due to the liberation of histamine, since on both compounds the anti-histaminic diphenhydramine has a pronounced inhibitory effect; 2. di-sodium-cromoglycate inhibits only the inflammatory action of the dekapeptide but has no effect on the activity of <span class="GENE">melittin</span>. <span class="GENE">melittin</span> and its fragment thus liberate histamine via different routes.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Expression of hepatitis B virus-specific markers in asymptomatic <span class="CHEMICAL">hepatitis b surface antigen</span> carriers. A study was undertaken to assess the state of hepatitis B virus infection in a group of asymptomatic <span class="CHEMICAL">hepatitis b surface antigen</span> (HBsAg) carriers. This study confirmed that the presence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in serum was closely associated with serum HBsAg-specific deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase activity, <span class="GENE">hepatitis b core antigen</span> (HBcAg) in serum and liver cell nuclei, and a histological picture of chronic hepatitis. No HBsAg-specific deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase activity or HBcAg was detected in highly concentrated anti-HBe-positive sera. In addition, liver biopsy specimens from carriers with anti-HBe were negative for HbcAg by immunofluorescence, and the liver histology was either normal or revealed only fatty changes. These data indicate that the anti-HBe-positive sera contained either no Dane particles or, if present, at least a 500-fold-lower concentration of Dane particles than that found in HBeAg-positive sera.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>The haemolytic effect of phallolysin. Phallolysin from the toadstool, Amanita phalloides, is a basic protein that causes direct haemolysis of red cells. The dose-response curve is steep; the pH optimum is in the weakly acid range. The rate of haemolysis increases with the concentration of the lysin, the optimal temperature is 20 degrees C. The percentage haemolysis-time curves are S-shaped. Haemolysis is of the non-osmotic type. Ca2+ is not required but inhibits haemolysis in a concentration-dependent fashion, as do Mg2+ and Zn2+. The red cell sensitivity of various animal species decreases in the following sequence:mouse greater than rabbit = guniea pig greater than rat greater than man greater than dog approximately or equal to pig greater than sheep = cattle. Red cells of cattle and sheep are largely resistant. Phallolysin is virtually not consumed on haemalysis: the amount of <span class="GENE">haemoglobin</span> released increases with the number of red cells applied; on repeated addition of fresh red cells the haemolysate retains its full activity. Phallolysin is not inhibited by serum, albumin, <span class="CHEMICAL">cholesterol</span>, lecithin, cephalin or sphingomyelin; inhibition by red cell ghosts of phallolysin haemolysis is considerably less than that of digitonin haemolysis. At sublytic concentrations phallolysin, unlike benzalkonium chloride, liberates practically no membrane lipids from human red cells. Surface activity of phallolysin does not exceed that of bovine serum albumin.-A saponin-like interaction with <span class="CHEMICAL">cholesterol</span> as the basic mechanism of haemolysis can be disregarded. There is also no evidence suggesting a detergent-like effect.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Mechanism of mitochondrial carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase: synthesis and properties of active CO2, precursor of carbamoyl phosphate. This paper demonstrates the formation of "active CO2" (CO2-P), a precursor of carbamoyl phosphate (CP), with frog liver carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase. Absence of <span class="CHEMICAL">ammonia</span> is essential for the demonstration by pulse incubation with H14CO3- of CO2-P. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and acetylglutamate are required for the synthesis of CO2-P, which is highly unstable in aqueous solutions (t1/2 = 0.75 s at 24 degrees C at neutral pH). In the absence of <span class="CHEMICAL">ammonia</span>, CO2-P attains rapidly a steady-state level, which depends on the concentration of ATP and HCO3-. The "apparent KM'S" are approximately equal to those found for the adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) activity of the enzyme. The maximum level of CO2-P is limited by the amount of enzyme, and approximates 4 mol of intermediate/mol of enzyme. The unprotonated form of <span class="CHEMICAL">ammonia</span> seems to be the species reacting with CO2-P to produce <span class="GENE">CP</span>. The reaction of CO2-P and NH3 is very fast (rate constant kn = 8 x 10(4) M-1 S-1) and does not consume free ATP. Therefore, the 2 mol of ATP necessary for <span class="GENE">CP</span> synthesis binds or reacts with the enzyme and/or CO2 prior to reaction with NH3. The reaction of CO2-P with NH3 also takes place in acetone under conditions at which the enzyme is not active, suggesting little or no assistance from enzyme catalysis or that a part of the catalytic site is "frozen" by the solvent in the active conformation. In the light of these and other findings, a new scheme is proposed for the mechanism of frog liver carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase and some considerations are made on the chemical nature of the intermediate and on the possible evolutionary significance of the reaction of CO2-P with NH3 in acetone.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Hepatotoxicity of erythromycin estolate during pregnancy. Women in the second half of pregnancy, who were infected with genital mycoplasmas and who gave written informed consent, were randomly assigned to receive capsules of identical appearance containing erythromycin estolate, <span class="CHEMICAL">clindamycin hydrochloride</span>, or a placebo for 6 weeks. Levels of serum <span class="GENE">glutamic oxalacetic transaminase</span> (SGOT) were determined before and during treatment by a fluorometric method. All pretreatment levels of SGOT were normal (&lt;41 units). Participants who received erythromycin estolate had significantly more abnormally elevated levels of SGOT (16/161, 9.9%) than did those who received clindamycin (4/168, 2.4%, P &lt; 0.01) or those who received placebo (3/165, 1.8%, P &lt; 0.01). Elevated levels of SGOT ranged from 44 to 130 U. Serum bilirubin levels were normal. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity was abnormal in six of six participants who had abnormal levels of SGOT while receiving erythromycin estolate. There were few associated symptoms, and all levels of SGOT returned to normal after cessation of treatment. The treatment of pregnant women with erythromycin estolate may be inadvisable.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>The chemical heterogeneity of human hemoglobin F. Direct evidence for the existence of three types of gamma chain, the G gamma I, A gamma I, and <span class="GENE">a gamma t chains</span>. Direct evidence is presented for the existence of three types of gamma chain of human hemoglobin F. A modification of a CM-cellulose chromatographic method has allowed the incomplete separation of these gamma chains while high pressure liquid chromatography and fingerprint analyses of tryptic peptides of zones of the isolated gamma chains, and <span class="CHEMICAL">amino acid</span> analyses of isolated peptides were used to identify the chains. These studies have shown that the presence of a glycyl residue in position 136 (G gamma chain) is directly related to that of an isoleucyl residue in position 75 (I gamma chain), thus indicating the existence of an G gamma I chain, and that the presence of an alanyl residue in position 136 (A gamma chain) can be related to that of an isoleucyl residue in position 75, thus suggesting the existence of an A gamma I chain. When the isoleucyl residue at positive 75 is replaced by a threonyl residue, invariably it is related to the alanyl substitution at position 136 (A gamma T chain). These data support indirect evidence from case analyses and family studies which were published before, and indicate that the T gamma chain is an allele of the A gamma which should be renamed the A gamma T chain.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>7-Bromo-5-(2'-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (I), a new tranquillizing agent: metabolism in rats. 1. After intraperitoneal injection of rats with the new benzodiazepine (compound I), four metabolites (compounds II, III, <span class="GENE">IV</span> and V) were found in the urine. 2. Compound II was identified as 7-bromo-5-(2'-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-3-hydroxy-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one by comparison of g.l.c. and mass spectral properties of the metabolite and synthetic compound. 3. Mass spectra of compound III and its acid hydrolysis products indicate that compound III contains a <span class="CHEMICAL">hydroxyl</span> group in the C(5)-phenyl ring. 4. Compounds <span class="GENE">IV</span> and V were identified by mass spectrometry as products of simultaneous aromatic hydroxylation and methoxylation of the diazepine I. 5. The major urinary excretion products are compounds III, <span class="GENE">IV</span> and V. Only very small amounts of compounds I and II were detected.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Purification and some properties of cholesterol oxidase from Schizophyllum commune with covalently bound flavin. Cholesterol oxidase [<span class="GENE">EC 1.1.3.6</span>] from Schizophyllum commune was purified by an affinity chromatography using 3-O-succinylcholesterol-ethylenediamine (3-cholesteryl-3-[2-aminoethylamido]propionate) Sepharose gels. The resulting preparation was homogeneous as judged by <span class="CHEMICAL">sodium dodecyl sulfate</span> (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 53,000 by SDS-gel electrophoresis and 46,000 by sedimentation equilibrium. The enzyme contained 483 amino acid residues as calculated on the basis of the molecular weight of 53,000. The enzyme consumed 60 mumol of O2/min per mg of protein with 1.3 mM cholesterol at 37 degrees C. The enzyme showed the highest activity with cholesterol; 3 beta-hydroxysteroids, such as dehydroepiandrosterone, pregnenolone, and lanosterol, were also oxidized at slower rates. Ergosterol was not oxidized by the enzyme. The Km for cholesterol was 0.33 mM and the optimal pH was 5.0. The enzyme is a flavoprotein which shows a visible absorption spectrum having peaks at 353 nm and 455 nm in 0.1 M acetate buffer, pH 4.0. The spectrum was characterized by the hypsochromic shift of the second absorption peak of the bound flavin. The bound flavin was reduced on anaerobic addition of a model substrate, dehydroepiandrosterone. Neither acid not heat treatment released the flavin coenzyme from the enzyme protein. The flavin of the enzyme could be easily released from the enzyme protein in acid-soluble form as flavin peptides when the enzyme protein was digested with trypsin plus chymotrypsin. The mobilities of the aminoacyl flavin after hydrolysis of the flavin peptides on thin layer chromatography and high voltage electrophoresis differed from those of free FAD, FMN, and riboflavin. A pKa value of 5.1 was obtained from pH-dependent fluorescence quenching process of the aminoacyl flavin. AMP was detected by hydrolysis of the flavin peptides with nucleotide pyrophosphatase. The results indicate strongly that cholesterol oxidase from Schizophyllum commune contains FAD as the prothetic group, which is covalently linked to the enzyme protein. The properties of the bound FAD were comparable to those of N (1)-histidyl FAD.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>[The coupling of beta1-24-corticotropin to the adenylate-cylase system in rat adipocytes. Evidence for hormone-nucleotides interaction (author's transl)]. The general aim was to define some of the most important parameters involved in the coupling step between the synthetic analog of adrenocoricotropin hormone  (beta1-24-corticotropin tetracosa peptide) and the catalytic unit of the adenylate-cyclase system of fat <span class="GENE">cells</span>.  These studies were performed with a purified plasma membrane fraction from rat adipose tissue.  In this regard, some effects of ions, pH, and <span class="CHEMICAL">nucleotides</span> (ATP nad GTP) on this hormone sensitive system were studied A simple model based on a random association process of reactants yeilded a statisfactory approximation of the kinetic data.  In contract to results obtained by two other groups, which were analyzed by De Haen, no evidence was found for a regulation of the adenylate-cyclase activity by the adenosine triphosphate which was not complexed to magnesium...</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Mitochondrial and cytosolic NADPH systems and <span class="GENE">isocitrate dehydrogenase</span> indicator metabolites during ureogensis from ammonia in isolated rat hepatocytes. 1. Citrate isocitrate and 2-oxoglutarate levels were determined in isolated rat hepatocytes and in particulate and soluble fractions, thereof, obtained by the <span class="CHEMICAL">digitonin</span> and silicone oil fractionation technique. 2. Caculated from isocitrate/2-oxoglutarate ratios ("indicator metabolite method"), the redox potential of mitochondrial free NADPH is -402 mV, whereas that of the extramitochondrial (cytosolic) space is about 10 mV more positive, -392 mV. 3; Addition of ammonia (either as ammonium chloride or from urea plus urease) to isolated hepatocytes causes preferential oxidation of mitochondrial NADPH, is demonstrated by spectrophotometry of the dihydro band and by the changes in the isocitrate/2-oxoglutarate ratios. The redox potential difference of free NADPH between mitochondria and cytosol is abolished or even reserved. 4. It is concluded that during urogenesis from ammonia mitochondrial isocitrate oxidation is shifted largely in favor of the NADP-linked as opposed to the NAD-linked enzyme; isocitrate concentration under these conditions is less than 10 muM, below the Km (isocitrate) of the NAD-linked enzyme but in the range of that for the NADP-linked enzyme. 5. Both in the absence and in the presence of ammonia there is a concentration gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane (from mitochondria to cytosol) for citrate, isocitrate, and also, to a smaller extent, for 2-oxoglutarate. 6. These results and data in the literature on enzyme activity are in agreement with the assumption of near-equilibrium of NADP-dependent <span class="GENE">isocitrate dehydrogenase</span>s in the mitochondrial matrix and cytosolic spaces in the absence of ammonia; accordingly, during urea formation from added ammonia the redox potential of mitochondrial free NADPH is increased to -391 mV or possibly even higher if there exists an indicator error under this condition.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>[Nisin formation by immobilized <span class="GENE">cells</span> of the <span class="CHEMICAL">lactic acid</span> bacterium, Streptococcus lactis]. The problem of microbial cell immobilization at present attracts the ever increasing attention of the scientists, since such organisms may be the source of various enzymes. Production of nizin by the immobilized <span class="GENE">cells</span> of Str. lactis was studied. It was found that the <span class="GENE">cells</span> of Str. lactis incorporated into polyacrylamide gel produced nizit on definite media. Still, the amount of the antibiotic was 2-3 times lower than in case of using free <span class="GENE">cells</span>. The effect of a number of factors on the process of immobilization was studied and the influence of some factors, such as temperature, pH, aeration on nizin synthesis by the immobilized <span class="GENE">cells</span> of the streptococcus was elucidated. Optimal conditions for nizin biosynthesis by the immobilized <span class="GENE">cells</span> of Str. lactis were developed.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Epidermal intercellular binding of <span class="GENE">concanavalin a</span> and pemphigus antibody. The binding sites of <span class="GENE">concanavalin a</span> (Con A) and pemphigus antibody in the intercellular spaces of the human epidermis have been investigated. Extraction of human skin with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 70% <span class="CHEMICAL">ethanol</span> resulted in complete loss of the binding sites of the pemphigus antibody, whereas the extracted skin still retained its reactivity to Con A. Preincubation with more than 0.25 mg/ml of Con A with normal skin caused a reduction in the binding of pemphigus sera. However, preincubation of pemphigus sera with human skin caused no inhibition of the subsequent binding of fluorescein-labelled Con A. These results indicate that Con A binding sites might be related to, but not identical with those of pemphigus antibody.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Stability of mammalian lens <span class="GENE">phosphofructokinase</span>. Two interconvertible <span class="GENE">phosphofructokinase</span> (PFK) forms were found in rat and human lenses; whereas only one predominant form was found in calf lens. PFK isolated from these lenses possessed a common property, i.e., pH-dependent cold (or acid) lability. The inactivation was prevented by including either <span class="CHEMICAL">adenosine triphosphate</span> (ATP) or fructose-6-phosphate (fru-6-P) in the incubating media. The protective effect of ATP or fru-6-P was complete in rat or calf lenses. In human lens, although fru-6-P was fully protective, ATP protected only partially. The inactivation could be reversed by addition of fru-6-P, but not ATP, to the incubating media at 37.5 degrees C. Lens organ culture studies showed that the depletion of lenticular ATP seemed to precipitate the loss of PFK.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Hormonal and metabolic responses to an enkephalin analogue in normal man. An enkephalin analogue [D-Ala2, MePhe4, Met(o)-ol] enkephalin (DAMME), given intravenously to normal subjects raised serum prolactin and growth-hormone levels but lowered serum levels of luteinising hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, cortisol, and <span class="GENE">corticotrophin</span>. There was also a small fall in total glucagon and gastric inhibitory peptide (G.I.P.) and a rise in thyrotrophin. beta-Lipotrophin, motilin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, insulin, gastrin, and pancreatic glucagon were unchanged. Blood-glycerol increased, and blood lactate, <span class="CHEMICAL">alanine</span>, and glucose fell. Prior administration of the opiate antagonist, naloxone, attenuated the hormonal responses to DAMME. This enkephalin analogue produces endocrine and metabolic changes in man which may be mediated through opiate-binding receptors both within and outside the brain. The enkephalins and related substances may provide an important link between perception, behaviour, and neuroendocrine regulation of hormone secretion and metabolism.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Purification from hamster cells of the multifunctional protein that initiates de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. Carbamyl-P synthetase (EC 2.7.2.9), aspartate transcarbamylase (EC 2.1.3.2), and dihydro-orotase (<span class="GENE">EC 3.5.2.3</span>), the first three enzymes of the de novo pathway for synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides, have been co-purified as a single oligomeric protein from a mutant line of hamster cells selected for its ability to resist N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA), a potent and specific inhibitor of aspartate transcarbamylase. All three enzymes overaccum,late in the mutant cells (Kempe, T.D., Swyryd, E.A., Bruist, M., and Stark, G.R. (1976) Cell 9, 541-550) and the oligomer represents nearly 10% of the total cellular protein. Tens of milligrams of oligomer have been purified to homogeneity by a simple and rapid procedure, with recovery of about 50% of all three activities. The pure protein contains only one size of polypeptide, Mr approximately 200,000, as revealed by electrophoresis in danaturing gels. All three enzyme activities are associated with this polypeptide, indicating that it is multifunctional. Further evidence for a multifunctional protein is provided by titration of the oligomer with radioactive <span class="CHEMICAL">PALA</span>, which reveals that the number of <span class="CHEMICAL">PALA</span> binding sites approximately equals the number of polypeptide chains. The isolated multifunctional protein is a mixture of trimers and hexamers.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Cell-mediated immunity in systemic lupus erythematosus: alterations with advancing age. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) was tested in young patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (mean age 30.9 years), in elderly patients with SLE (mean age 70.8 years), and in young and elderly control subjects. Pre-existing CMI as evaluated by skin test response to <span class="GENE">PPD</span> and mumps antigens and the response of peripheral blood lymphocytes in culture to the mitogen phytohemagglutinin was not significantly different in thefour groups. However, the mean area of induration to Candida <span class="CHEMICAL">antigen</span> was significantly less in both groups of elderly patients, suggesting a diminution of CMI with advancing age. Elderly control subjects and elderly patients with SLE had a significant decrease in incidence and severity of skin-test response when sensitized with 2-4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), suggesting that the capacity to respond to a new <span class="CHEMICAL">antigen</span> is impaired in the elderly, with and without SLE.

The effects of luminal instillation of 16,16 dimethyl PGE2 (dmPGE2) on gastric acid secretion and back diffusion of H+ were studied in anaesthetised dogs which were prepared with a segment of the greater curvature of the stomach mounted in a double lumen chamber. This model permitted simultaneous evaluation of two segments of mucosa, one control and the other test, supplied by the same vascular pedicle. Imfusion of histamine (1.0 microgram/kg/min, intravenously) stimulated brisk acid secretion in both chambers. Topical application of 25 microgram dmPGE2 in 20 ml 0.3 M <span class="CHEMICAL">HC1</span> to the test chamber for 30 minutes prevented acid secretion from the test mucosa during a second histamine infusion. Since the control chamber showed no evidence of inhibition this indicates that dmPGE2 acted directly on the secretory <span class="GENE">cells</span>, rather than after absorption from the bloodstream. This observation, however, does not exclude a possible local effect on mucosal blood flow. Direct exposure of the gastric mucosa to dmPGE2 increased the rate of back diffusion of H+ because of disruption of the permeability barrier, indicated by increased H+ back diffusion, Na+ efflux, and a reduction in potential difference. However, H+ loss was small compared to the reduction in acid output.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Hapten-specific hemolytic plaque assays usually fail to detect most of the diversity in the anti-hapten response. Immunization of rabbits or mice with a single, chemically defined hapten elicits populations of plaque-forming cells (PFC) detectable not only on sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) bearing the immunizing hapten, but also on SRBC bearing structural analogues of the immunizing hapten. Most of these analogue-reactive PFC preferentially lyse analogue-conjugated SRBC and cannot be detected on erythrocytes bearing the immunizing hapten. Thus, they represent heretofore largely unstudied components of the secretory B-cell response to haptenic immunization, and they have been termed alloreactive PFC. Such alloreactive PFC are detectable using either classical small haptens or tripeptide-enlarged counterparts of these classical haptens. They are present in large numbers both in direct and in indirect PFC assays, and they are elicited in response to both thymic-dependent and thymic-independent <span class="CHEMICAL">antigens</span>. Relatively few alloreactive PFC can be attributed to cells producing hapten-carrier or "bridge area"-specific antibodies. Since the antibodies released by alloreactive PFC can also be detected by passive hemagglutination, their presence does not appear attributable to vagaries of complement activation. Numerous coexisting alloreactive PFC populations are detectable after haptenic immunization. In early direct PFC responses it is not nucommon for a single alloreactive PFC population to outnumber the population of PFC detectable on SRBC bearing the actual immunizing hapten. These alloreactive PFC may be the source of at least some of the new "nonspecific" Ig which is formed at the time of immunization but about which little is known for lack of available techniques. Some possible implications of these findings on the specificity of B precursor <span class="GENE">cell</span> activation are discussed.</td></tr></table></div>

Druing this period the circling response to <span class="CHEMICAL">apomorphine hydrochloride</span> (0.01-0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) was increasingly suppressed in comparison to control animals, while spontaneous locomotor activity increased. Following drug withdrawal the circling response to apomorphine remained suppressed two months later. However, spontaneous locomotor activity was also reduced up to 1 month following drug removal. The dopamine content of the lesioned side of the forebrain was 25% of the intact side in control animals and was not further reduced by amphetamine administration. The dopamine content of the intact forebrain was reduced by 43% during amphetamine administration and remained 18% depressed 1 month following drug withdrawal. No changes in 5-hydroxytryptamine or noradrenaline concentrations were observed in either the intact or lesioned side. This data, while showing that chronic amphetamine treatment can induce persistent changes in dopamine receptor sensitivity, can be interpreted in terms of increased striatal receptor sensitivity or as a decreased response of <span class="GENE">dopamine receptors</span> in the nucleus accumbens.</td></tr></table></div>

We have previously reported on test systems, based on 5alpha-reductase (5alpha-RA) and <span class="GENE">arginase</span> activities and steroid deposition in animal prostates, potentially useful in screening drugs possibly effective in cancer of the prostate. Recently, we have concentrated on the development of other in vivo and in vitro systems which may prove of further value in testing such drugs. These systems include the following: (a) The effects of drugs on 5alpha-RA activity in human and animal non-malignant and human cancerous prostatic tissues in organ culture. The parameters necessary for the maintenance of optimal 5alpha-RA in such explants have been determined, and it has been shown that certain agents (estramustine phosphate, progesterone, estradiol-17beta) can inhibit 5alpha-RA under in vitro conditions, pointing to the potential use of such an approach in screening various cytostatic agents. In addition, 65Zn deposition, the histology, and the androgen metabolism in such tissues in organ culture are being determined as additional parameters. (b) The deposition of 65Zn in the rat dorsolateral gland, particularly as affected by prolactin and testosterone, and the effects of chemotherapeutic agents on such deposition. Methotrexate and <span class="CHEMICAL">CCNU</span> have been shown to be potent inhibitors of 65Zn deposition in the dorsolateral gland. The parameters related to zinc metabolism in the prostate are being further investigated. (c) The demonstration of receptors for estrogens (estradiol-17beta, diethylstilbestrol) in the prostate of the baboon. The various parameters related to the specificity of such receptors have been established. The development and standardization of these approaches, some facets of which are reported in the present publication, may prove them to be more sensitive, specific, and optimal than other systems and should afford an opportunity to test various combinations of drugs potentially useful in cancer of the prostate with relative speed, efficacy, and ease of manipulation.</td></tr></table></div>

The osmotic gradient was made by five- or tenfold dilution of the internal Ringer solution. The water flow was estimated gravimetrically. The water flow was induced by pituitrin (50 milliunits/ml), cyclic AMP (cAMP, 0.5-10(-3) M) and nystatine (3.5-10(-5) M).

Hapten--carrier complexes were prepared with the 2,4-dinitrophenyl group (DNP) as a hapten and heterologous bovine serum albumin (BSA) and isologous mouse immunoglobulin (MIg) as carriers. Priming of donor mice with carrier alone did not prepare for a secondary (IgG) response in the recipients of hapten--carrier. Priming of donors and challenge of recipients with the same hapten--carrier complex resulted in high IgG responses. Whereas donor and recipient immunization with complexes differing in the carrier did not give a secondary response, addition of cells of donors immunized with the carrier of the complex used for challenge, resulted in a secondary response. This was only possible when at least one of the complexes had an intermediate hapten:carrier ratio. Only an IgM or a low IgG response was obtained if both complexes had a high hapten:carrier ratio.

Clozapine and chlorprothixene on the other hand, have high affinity for <span class="GENE">muscarinic receptors</span> and also antagonize the effect of histamine and 5-HT, whereas clozapine was a weak antagonist of noradrenaline and <span class="CHEMICAL">dopamine</span> when compared to the effect of piflutixol. Chlorprothixene, however, also exhibits a rather good antagonism of noradrenaline and <span class="CHEMICAL">dopamine</span>. Haloperidol proved to be weak in all models when compared with the other neuroleptics examined. Flupenthixol specifically antagonizes <span class="CHEMICAL">dopamine</span> and noradrenaline, whereas fluphenazine was a more potent antagonist of <span class="CHEMICAL">dopamine</span> than of the other transmitters. The data show, that neuroleptic compounds possess very different profiles with regard to interaction with various neurotransmitter substances.

<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>The role of <span class="GENE">cytochrome p-450</span> in the hydroperoxide-catalyzed oxidation of alcohols by rat-liver microsomes. The organic hydroperoxide cumene hydroperoxide is capable of oxidizing ethanol to acetaldehyde in the presence of either catalase, purified <span class="GENE">cytochrome p-450</span> or rat liver microsomes. Other hemoproteins like horseradish peroxidase, cytochrome c or hemoglobin were ineffective. In addition to ethanol, higher alcohols like 1-propanol, 1-butanol and 1-pentanol are also oxidized to their corresponding aldehydes to a lesser extent. Other organic hydroxyperoxides will replace cumene hydroperoxide in oxidizing ethanol but less effectively. The cumene-hydroperoxide-dependent ethanol oxidation in microsomes was inhibited partially by <span class="GENE">cytochrome p-450</span> inhibitors but was unaffected by catalase inhibitors. <span class="CHEMICAL">phenobarbital</span> pretreatment of rats increased the specific activity of the cumene-hydroperoxide-dependent ethanol oxidation per mg of microsomes about seven-fold. The evidence suggests that <span class="GENE">cytochrome p-450</span> rather than catalase is the enzyme responsible for hydroperoxide-dependent ethanol oxidation. However, when H2O2 is used in place of cumene hydroperoxide, the microsomal ethanol oxidation closely resembles the catalase system.</td></tr></table></div>

The purifed enzyme preparations have a pH optimum of activity at 7--7,5. The enzymes molecular weight was approximatelyy 30--40.000. Enzyme activity was inhibited by L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone, p-chloromercuribenzoate and divalent ions Co2+, Zn2+ and was significantly enhanced by dithiothreitol. The Km values for the reaction of hydrolysis of luliberin and hemoglobin were 1,33.10(-5) and 5,2.10(-5) M respectively.

Bucolome, one of <span class="CHEMICAL">barbiturate</span> derivatives, lowers plasma bilirubin in Gilbert's syndrome without inductive effect on liver microsomal enzymes. To clarify the mechanism of this action, the study was performed concerning the effects of bucolome and five other closely related <span class="CHEMICAL">barbiturate</span> derivatives including phenobarbital (PB) on plasma bilirubin in homozygous Gunn rats and on albumin-bilirubin binding in vitro. When 15 mg/100 g of bucolome was administered to Gunn rats, remarkable drop in plasma bilirubin continued for more than 48 hrs. This decrease of bilirubin was returned to preinjection level after intravenous injection of albumin. Three Gunn rats died as a result of administration of 30 mg/100 g. This dose caused no pathological change in control rats. In in vitro study, bucolome displaced bilirubin from human albumin strongly. <span class="GENE">PB</span> had almost no effect on the plasma bilirubin in Gunn rats and the in vitro action was very small.

<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Membrane potentials in pinched-off presynaptic nerve ternimals monitored with a fluorescent probe: evidence that synaptosomes have potassium diffusion potentials. 1. Some physiological properties of tissue fractions from rat brain homogenates have been examined. Of the three fractions studied (presynaptic nerve terminals, mitochondria and fragmented membranes), only the nerve terminals (synaptosomes) have the ability to accumulate 42K from physiological salt solutions. 2. The ability to accumulate and retain K is lost if synaptosomes are exposed to very hypotonic solutions. The K uptake and total K content is reduced by ouabain and by inhibitors of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. 3. These results suggest that synaptosomes in physiological saline accumulate K against a concentration gradient, and may have K diffusion potentials across their surface membranes. The voltage-sensitive fluorescent probe, 3,3'-dipentyl 2,2'-oxacarbocyanine (CC5), was used to test this possibility. 4. In the squid axon, the fluorescent emission of CC5 is directly proportional to membrane potential; depolarization causes an increase in fluorescence. 5. The fluorescence of synaptosomes ('synaptosome fluorescence') treated with CC5 is increased when [K]o is increased or [K]o is reduced; replacement of external Na by Li or choline has little effect on the synaptosome fluorescence. In quantitative terms, synaptosome fluorescence is proportional to log ([K]o plus 0-05[Na]o). <span class="GENE">rb</span> is about as effective as K in enhancing synaptosome fluorescence; Cs is about 1/4 as effective. The effect of increased [K]o is reversible. 6. The fluorescence data provide corroborative evidence that there is normally a large K gradient ([K]o smaller than [I]i) across the synaptosome surface membrane. The data suggest the [K]i may be in excess of 100 mM. 7. Replacement of Cl- by methylsulphate did not significantly affect the relationship between synaptosome fluorescence and [K]o, nor did removal of external Ca. 8. The fluorescence of CC5-treated mitochondria, membrane fragmnets, or lysed synaptosomes is unaffected by changes in the K concentration of the medium. 9. Veratridine and gramicidin D, both of which enhance Na permeability (PNa) in some intact tissues, increase synaptosome fluorescence when added to the standard medium. The increment is greatly reduced or abolished when external Na is replaced by choline. 10. If synaptosomes are first Na-loaded (by pre-treatment with <span class="CHEMICAL">cyanide</span> + iodoacetate), and then placed in a choline medium, addition of gramicidin D significantly decreases fluorescence. This effect could be explained if, with [Na]o smaller than [Na]i, the increase in PNa causes the synaptosomes to hyperpolarize. 11. The veratridine-induced increase in synaptosome fluorescence was prevented by 3 times 10- minus 7M tetrodotoxin, which also blocks the depolarizing effect of veratridine in intact neurones. 12. The main conclusion is that synaptosomes may retain resting membrane potentials and the ability to increase Na permeability.</td></tr></table></div>

Four fibre groups (E, <span class="GENE">M1</span>, M2, M3) were recorded at latencies of approximately 2, 3, 5 and 8 ms after stimulation (conduction velocities of approximately 7, 5, 3 and 2 m/s).

Fibre groups <span class="GENE">M1</span>, M2 and M3 gave rise to postsynaptic potentials which, following computation of their second spatial derivatives with depth, were found to have current sinks at depths of approximately 100-150 micrometers, 150--200 micrometers and 250--350 micrometers respectively. Thus the fastest conducting retinotectal fibres make their synapses most superficially, the opposite of the arrangement in the frog tectum. These postsynaptic waves fatigued at repetitive stimulus rates of 20--50 per second, and in twin pulses at interstimulus intervals of 10--15 ms; and they were reversibly blocked by topical application of pentobarbitol. The fibre potentials, however, were virtually undecremented under these conditions. To compare these electrophysiological findings with the anatomy, the <span class="CHEMICAL">cobalt</span> procedure was used to visualize the profiles of the optic fibres in the various tectal laminae. A thick dense projection filled the superficial grey and white (s.g.w.) layer, and there was a thin satellite band just superficial to it. In addition, there were two deeper bands of sparse innervation, in the middle of the central grey zone (c.g.) and in the deep white (d.w.) layer.

Using the measured rate constants for the dissociations, and the known variation in fluorescence of flavin nucleotides with pH, an analogue computer simulation of the dissociation as well as a manual curve-fitting procedure showed that the biphasic response could be explained as a simultaneous rapid dissociation of FAD and a slower loss of FMN from the protein.</td></tr></table></div>

(1) For <span class="CHEMICAL">ferrous</span> alkylated cytochrome c, a Raman line sensitive to the replacement of an axial ligand of the heme iron uas found around 1540 cm=1. This ligand-sensitive Raman line indicated the transition from acidic (1545 cm-1) to alkaline (1533 cm-1) forms with pK 7.9. The pH dependence of the Raman spectrum corresponded well to that of the optical absorption spectra. (2) For <span class="CHEMICAL">ferrous</span> <span class="GENE">cytochrome f</span>, the ligand-sensitive Raman line was found at the same frequency as cytochrome c (1545 cm-1). Accordingly two axial ligands are likely to be histidine and methionine as in cytochrome c. (3) For <span class="CHEMICAL">ferrous</span> cytochrome c3, the frequency of the ligand-sensitive Raman line was between those of cytochrome c and cytochrome b5. Since two axial ligands of the heme iron in cytochrome c3 might be histidines. However, a combination of histidine and methionine as a possible set of two axial ligands was not completely excluded for one or two of the four hemes.

The difference in frequency and intensity between B- and C-types of hemes implies that the low effective symmetry of the heme in <span class="CHEMICAL">ferrous</span> cytochrome c is due to vibrational coupling of ring modes with peripheral substituents rather than geometrical disortion of heme.</td></tr></table></div>

Recent studies indicate that coronary vessels have alpha- and beta-2-adrenergic receptors and that the alpha receptors are functionally innervated. We studied whether the beta-2-vasodilator receptors are functionally innervated, using a dog in situ modified Langendorff preparation with constant coronary perfusion pressure. The beating, nonworking heart and systemic circulation were supported with a pump oxygenator. Stimulation of the left stellate ganglion increased coronary blood flow and decreased coronary sinus oxygen tension from prestimulation control values. After beta-1-receptor blockade (practolol, 10 mg/kg), stellate stimulation decreased coronary blood flow and decreased coronary sinus oxygen tension from prestimulation control values, revealing alpha-receptor vasoconstriction. After the addition of alpha-receptor blockade (Dibozane, 5 mg/kg), stellate stimulation increased coronary blood flow and coronary sinus oxygen tension a small amount from prestimulation values. Finally, after the addition of beta-2-receptor blockade (propranolol, 2 mg/kg), stellate stimulation increased flow and coronary sinus oxygen tension slightly from prestimulation control values.

Both the anionic detergent sodium dodecylsulphate and the cationic detergent cetyltrimethylammonium bromide quenched the protein fluorescence of <span class="GENE">glutamate dehydrogenase</span>. The anionic compound was more effective and brought about 50% quenching at a detergent concentration of 0.4 mM. The zwitterionic amphiphile, lysolecithin, did not quench the protein fluorescence and neither did the short-chain detergent n-hexylsulphonate, which under the range of concentrations examined (less than 1 mM) does not form micelles. 2. The zwitterionic phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine, did not quench the protein fluorescence but the anionic phospholipids, <span class="CHEMICAL">phosphatidylserine</span> and cardiolipin, induced a reversible quenching of the enzyme fluorescence. These observations confirm the specificity of the phospholipid-enzyme interactions as deduced from the kinetic studies of the preceding paper. The degree of quenching brought about by the phospholipids decreased with increasing ionic strength and increasing pH and could be substantially reduced by basic proteins. An electrostatic contribution to the interaction is inferred from these results. 3. The binding of the anionic phospholipids to the enzyme is manifested in a further enhancement of the fluorescence of a 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulphonate-enzyme complex. The presence of substrates and allosteric effectors affect the interaction of the lipids with the enzyme as indicated by the magnitude of this increase in fluorescence. The enhancement of fluorescence of NADH when bound to the enzyme was not affected by the binding of the lipids. 4. The complex formed between the enzyme and phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine can be solubilized in isooctane. The photolability of the aqueous protein when subjected to irradiation at 280 nm is suppressed in the isooctane-soluble complex. 5. <span class="CHEMICAL">phosphatidylserine</span> brings about a rapid (t 1/2 is about 150 ms at a lipid concentration of 0.75 mM) dissociation of the linear aggregates formed between the enzyme oligomers. 6.

<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Osmiophilic <span class="CHEMICAL">reagents</span> in electronmicroscopic histocytochemistry. Direct histocytochemical staining methods on undisrupted tissues, stabilized by chemical fixation, potentially offer perhaps the most reliable approach to the study of the enzymes of the cell with relation to its ultrastructure. The atoms which, for the most part, comprise the biomacromolecules and enzymes of cells and tissues contribute little to their inherent electron opacity or ability to scatter electrons differentially. The latter property of a substance is responsible for its observation with the electron microscope. Since the introduction of osmiophilic <span class="CHEMICAL">reagents</span> into cytochemistry (HANKER et al. 1964), the selective deposition of relatively large amounts of polymeric osmium black reaction products at the subcellular sites of insoluble or immobilized enzymes or biomacromolecules has facilitated their demonstration with the light and electron microscopes. Perhaps the most widely employed osmiophilic reagent in histocytochemistry has been DAB which was introduced by GRAHAM and KARNOVSKY (1966a, b). Although it receives its widest use for demonstrating the sites to which the exogenous ultrastructural tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is transported in vertebrate tissues, it is also widely employed for the demonstration of catalase in peroxisomes with the media of FAHIMI (1969) or of NOVIKOFF and GOLDFISCHER (1969), and for the demonstration of <span class="GENE">cytochrome oxidase</span> with the medium of SELIGMAN et al. (1968a). The importance of this reagent lies in its ability to undergo oxidative polymerization forming an insoluble osmiophilic melanin-like product (HANKER et al. 1972a) which comforms well to ultrastructure, at the sites of enzymic or nonenzyme proteins which catalyze its oxidation. In the past few years, studies in our laboratory have shown that a rational approach to the histocytochemical demonstration of enzymes could be devised. It is based on the selective deposition of transition metal compounds at the sites of enzymes that resemble hemoproteins in their ability to catalyze the oxidative polymerization of DAB. The most useful of these compounds, cupric ferrocyanide (Hatchett's brown) was also introduced into cytochemistry by Karnovsky's laboratory (KARNOVSKY 1964; KARNOVSKY and ROOTS 1974). By the use of natural substrates, when available, or synthetic substrates which liberate or form a reducing agent at the sites of the enzymatic activity, many diverse types of enzymes have been demonstrated by methods depending on this principle known as catalytic osmiophilic polymer generation. DAB has probably been the most useful histocytochemical reagent of the past decade. Yet its borderline carcinogenicity and the frequent interruption of a supply of good quality DAB have encouraged research into a substitute reagent. A new substitute for DAB has resulted from the study of artificial melanins in our laboratory for several years. It consists of a mixture of p-phenylenediamine and pyrocatechol and is much better than DAB for the demonstration of HRP used as a cytochemical tracer...</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>The class of surface immunoglobulin on virgin and memory B lymphocytes. The class of surface immunoglobulin receptors for antigen on B cell precursors of different classes of antibody-forming cells was determined by utilizing a technique of class-specific antigen suicide. Spleen cells are first treated with a class-specific antiserum under conditions that result in the stripping of that class from the cell surface. The cells are then permitted to bind a highly radioactive <span class="CHEMICAL">trinitrophenyl</span> (TNP)-conjugated protein, which leads to lethal irradiation of all TNP-specific B cells except those whose <span class="GENE">TNP</span> receptors had been removed by the class-specific stripping of surface immunoglobulin. In this way, the class of antibody-forming cells resulting from <span class="GENE">TNP</span> stimulation of B cells with different classes of surface immunoglobulin can be examined. It was found that the virgin B cell precursors of IgM-producing cells are two types: cells bearing IgM receptors only and those bearing both IgM and IgD receptors. All virgin B cells that gave rise to IgG1 antibody-forming cells had both IgM and IgD on their surfaces, demonstrating that an antigen-dependent switch from IgM and IgD to IgG1 production is a common feature of B cell maturation. In contrast, memory B cell precursors of IgG1 antibody-forming cells had predominantly IgG1 as their surface antigen receptor. The implications of these findings on current models of B cell maturation are analyzed.</td></tr></table></div>

Using the immunoperoxidase technique and antisera to the specific beta (beta) subunits of FSH and LH1, selective immunochemical staining was localized mostly in the same cell type in the pars distalis and pars tuberalis of the dog pituitary gland. However, some cells were consistently shown to react solely with antisera to either <span class="GENE">LH</span> beta of FSH beta. The cells stained for FSH beta were at least 1.5 times less numerous than those shown to contain <span class="GENE">LH</span> beta. In the pars distalis of adult male dogs the immunoreactive gonadotrophs varied greatly in their relative proportion and were mostly shown to be much less numerous than in bitches in the anestrus phase of the sexual cycle.

<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Intracellular distinction between peroxidase and catalase in exocrine <span class="GENE">cells</span> of rat lacrimal gland: a biochemical and cytochemical study. The lacrimal gland (Glandula orbitalis externa) of rat contains both peroxidase and catalase and was used as a model for biochemical and cytochemical distinction between peroxidase and catalase. Both enzymes were isolated by ammonium sulfate precipitation from tissue homogenates, and the effects of fixation with glutaraldehyde and various conditions of incubation were investigated colorimetrically using DAB as <span class="CHEMICAL">hydrogen</span> donor. The lacrimal gland peroxidase is strongly inhibited by glutaraldehyde treatment. In contrast, for catalase the fixation with glutaraldehyde is the prerequistie for demonstration of its peroxidatic activity. The maximal peroxidatic activity was obtained after treatment of catalase with 3% glutaraldehyde, higher concentrations being inhibitory. For lacrimal gland peroxidase, the maximal rate of oxidation of DAB is at pH 6.5, whereas for catalase it is at pH 10.5. The optimal concentration of H2O2 for lacrimal gland peroxidase is at 10(-3)M and for peroxidatic activity of catalase at 10(-1)M. These optimal conditions obtained biochemically were applied to tissue sections of rat lacrimal gland. After the fixation of tissue with a low concentration of glutaraldehyde and incubation in the DAB medium at neutral pH containing 10(-3)M H2O2 (Peroxidase medium), the reaction product was localized in the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, in elements of the Golgi apparatus, and in secretory granules. After the fixation of tissue with 3% glutaraldehyde and incubation in the DAB-medium containing 10(-1)M H2O2 and at pH 10.5 (catalase medium), the staining in the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi-apparatus and in secretory granules was completely inhibited and reaction product was localized exclusively in small (0.2-0.5 mu) particles similar to small peroxisomes described in various other cell-types.</td></tr></table></div>

The cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) content of isolated unstimulated mast cells and the changes induced by a variety of pharmacologic, metabolic, and physical stimuli were studied. A modified <span class="GENE">bovine serum albumin</span> density gradient purification method consistently provided mast cell preparations which were 95% or more pure, without apparent damage, and a 73% recovery of the mast cells applied to the gradients. The measured cAMP in unstimulated mast cells was high, a mean of 16 picomoles per million cells. Moderate agitation or contact with glass increased cAMP content about 2-fold. When calcium was omitted from the medium mast cell cAMP was markedly elevated; incremental increases in added calcium ion concentration from 1 muM to 1 mM caused a linear decrease in cAMP content. Theophylline (3 to 20 mM) caused a dose-related increase in mast cell cAMP content, approximately 2-fold at 20 mM theophylline. Epinephrine (0.01 to 1 mM) caused a modest, dose-related increase in cAMP. In the presence of theophylline, epinephrine increased cAMP levels equal to or greater than the sum of the effects of the agents used individually. The increase in cAMP induced by epinephrine was completely inhibited by 100 muM <span class="CHEMICAL">propranolol</span> and partially inhibited by 10 muM <span class="CHEMICAL">propranolol</span>, thus suggesting that a beta adrenergic receptor is involved. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and histamine (in the presence of theophylline) also raised cAMP. Carbamylcholine (1 nM) lowered cAMP 38%; Atropine (0.1 mM) inhibited the decrease in cAMP induced by 1 nM carbamylcholine by 83% indicating that a muscarinic receptor is involved. In these homogeneous single cell suspensions, therefore, cholinergic and beta adrenergic agents have opposing effects on cAMP levels. Diazoxide (10 muM) and adenine (1 muM) caused 37 and 32% decreases in cAMP, respectively. The availability of highly purified mast cells and the identification of agents which either decrease or increase cAMP content allows a direct examination of the role of cAMP in histamine release.</td></tr></table></div>

Besides dynein, which can be solubulized from Chlamydomonas flagella as a heterogeneous, Mg2+ or Ca2+-activated ATPase, we have purified and characterized five other flagellar enzymes involved in nucleotide transformations. A homogeneous, low molecular weight, Ca2+-specific adenosine triphosphatase was isolated, which was inhibited by Mg2+ and was not specific for ATP. This enzyme was not formed by treating purified dynein with <span class="GENE">proteases</span>. It was absent from extracts of Tetrahymena cilia.

Effects of various hormonal and pharmacological manipulations on somatostatin distribution were investigated to elucidate the physiological significance of somatostatin in the hypothalamus and the other regions of the rat brain. Immunoreactive somatostatin (IRS) was measured by radioimmunoassay newly developed. Insulin induced an increase of hypothalamic <span class="GENE">IRS</span> and a decrease of plasma RGH, while glucose administration resulted in the opposite responses, which were not significant. Insulin also increased <span class="GENE">IRS</span> in the thalamus and the brain stem. The insulin-induced increase of hypothalamic <span class="GENE">IRS</span> was reduced by hyperglycemia.

The intramitochondrially located phosphate-dependent <span class="GENE">glutaminase</span> pathway is generally believed to be of primary importance. Adaptation involved either enhanced glutamine entry into the mitrochondria and/or activation of phosphate-dependent <span class="GENE">glutaminase</span>, but the relative importance of each has not been resolved definitively. The overall adaptive response is probably modulated by factors regulating alpha-ketoglutarate metabolism to phosphoenolpyruvate, and possibly also by metabolism of TCA cycle intermediates.

<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Distribution of mucosubstances in adenoid cystic carcinoma. The distribution of mucosubstances in adenoid cystic carcinoma was investigated, and an attempt was made to characterize histochemically the various mucosubstances present. For these purposes the high iron diamine technique (HID), as well as the Astra blue, aldehyde fuchsin and Alcian blue staining methods were employed. Alcian blue was further combined with the <span class="CHEMICAL">periodic acid</span>-Schiff (PAS) technique, the Alcian blue being applied at pH levels between 0.5 and 2.5. In addition the effect of neuraminidase and hyaluronidase treatment as well as methylation and acid hydrolysis procedures on the staining qualities were studied. Acidic mucosubstances with varying histochemical properties were present in different structures of the neoplasm. The characteristic pseudocyst, a major structural component of the neoplasm, stained strongly with HID, Astra blue, aldehyde fuchsin and Alcian blue at low pH. These staining reactions were markedly suppressed by hyaluronidase treatment, and are apparently attributable to the presence of chondroitin 4- and/or 6-sulfate. Employing the Alcian blue-critical electrolyte concentration technique, the basophilia of the pseudocysts was suppressed at a concentration of 0.5-0.6 M MgCl2, which might indicate polysaccharides of relatively low degree of sulfation. An additional, non-sulfated acid mucin could also be demonstrated in these structures. In certain duct and gland like structures of the tumours, a change in staining pattern from blue or blue-red to red could be observed after exposure of the sections to neuraminidase and subsequent staining with the Alcian blue (pH 2.5)-PAS sequence. Similar observations were also made when the pH of the Alcian blue was lowered to 1.5-1.0, as well as after acid hydrolysis. These findings afford evidence for the presence of a neuraminidase susceptive <span class="GENE">sialomucin</span> in certain epithelial secretions of the tumor. At the ultrastructural level the replicated basement lamina of the pseudocysts displayed a strong positive reaction with the PA-CrA-silver staining technique.

A mechanism is proposed for catalysis which includes both the protonated and unprotonated form of the imidazoyl (His-57) and utilizes water rather than a carboxyl (Asp-102) as the proton sink.</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>The role of adrenergic receptors in the regulation of gastric motility in the rat. Gastric motility was investigated under the effect of adrenergic receptor agonist and antagonist substances in albino rats of both sexes and weighing 150 to 180 g. Gastric evacuation was studied, after introducing 2 ml/100 g of Novobarium suspension in the stomach, by radioscopy and radiography. Epinephrine (Tonogen) was found to inhibit gastric motility, this inhibition being effective even after pylorotomy. The dominantly alpha adrenergic agonist <span class="CHEMICAL">phenylephrine</span> (Sympathomim) had not any effect; the alpha blocker phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline) slightly depressed gastric evaluation. A marked inhibitory influence was noted with stimulating the <span class="GENE">beta receptors</span> by isoproterenol (Prophylon), while propranolol (Inderal) slightly accelerated gastric evacuation by blocking <span class="GENE">beta receptors</span>. A pretreatment by phenoxybenzamine of the animals did not affect epinephrine influence whereas a pretreatment by propranolol completely abolished the inhibitory effect of epinephrine on gastric motility. These results suggest the presence of a slight beta receptor tone in gastric motility at rest, and indicate further that epinephrine exerts its inhibitory effect on gastric motility via adrenergic <span class="GENE">beta receptors</span>.</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Simultaneous complementary idiotypic responses: absence of reciprocal regulation. Complementary antibodies, i.e. antibodies having combining site structures which are at least partially directed against each other, were induced in A/He mice by immunization with <span class="CHEMICAL">phosphorylcholine</span> (Pc) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin or with the Pc-binding IgA myeloma protein, HOPC-8 (H8). Both responses were monitored by enumerating plaque-forming <span class="GENE">cells</span> and assaying serum antibody levels to Pc and H8. Prior immunization with H8 markedly suppressed subsequent immunization with Pc and vice versa; neither plaque-forming cell response was diminished, however, when mice were immunized simultaneously with Pc and H8. Experiments were designed to determine if the absence of reciprocal regulation was due to change in idiotypes. This was determined by measuring inhibition of plaque formation using complementary antibody. Plaque formation by <span class="GENE">cells</span> was equally inhibited by high dilutions of the appropriate complementary antibody whether <span class="GENE">cells</span> were from mice immunized with one, the other, or both antigens. Thus, the absence of regulation could not be accounted for by emergence of different idiotypes. Interestingly, sera from mice immunized to have high responses to both antigens were relatively ineffective in inhibiting plaque formation or suppressing immunization to Pc. However, such sera contained complexes of the complementary antibodies; apparently antibody to Pc in such sera quenches or neutralizes the activity of anti-H8 antibody. But the formation of complexes, at least measurable levels of circulating complexes, must be a result rather than the cause for the absence of reciprocal regulation, since regulation was also absent when immunization to Pc was manipulated so that responses were too low to result in detectable levels of circulating antibody to Pc. It is proposed that simultaneous complementary responses may occur in nature to other antigens and antibodies, and that such simultaneous responses may cause pathologic changes.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Latency of inosine-5'-diphosphatase in microsomes isolated from rat liver. The latency of inosine-5'-diphosphatase has been studied in microsomes isolated from rat liver. The appearance of latent activity was the result of an increase in the Vmax of the enzyme. This was observed when assays were carried out in the presence of sodium deoxycholate, after microsomes were treated wtih phospholipase C, or at pH 10.3 and after microsomes were subjected to nitrogen cavitation. The apparent Km of inosine-5'-diphosphatase for <span class="GENE">IDP</span> was unchanged when microsomes were treated with phospholipase C or at pH 10.3 after both these treatments approximately 85% of the enzyme remained bound to the membrane. In contrast, when microsomes were treated with phospholipase C or at pH 10.3 after both these treatments approximately 85% of the enzyme remained bound to the membrane. In contrast, when microsomes were treated with sodium deoxycholate or subjected to nitrogen cavitation, approximately 75% of the inosine-5'-diphosphatase activity was released from the membrane, and the apparent Km of the enzyme for <span class="GENE">IDP</span> increased 4- and 2-fold, respectively. Microsomal cisternae were loaded with lead phosphate by incubation with glucose-6-P and Pb2+, and the release of this lead phosphate following the addition of <span class="CHEMICAL">EDTA</span> to the medium was determined to estimate the permeability of the microsomal membrane. When microsomes were treated with sodium deoxycholate, phospholipase C, or at alkaline pH, the microsomal membrane became almost completely permeable to <span class="CHEMICAL">EDTA</span> under conditions where there was little or no increase in the activity of inosine-5'-diphosphatase. Microsomes were treated at pH 10.3 and then adjusted slowly to pH 7.5. The activity of inosine-5'-diphosphatase decreased to the same activity observed in untreated preparations. The results seem of exclude the possibility that latent inosine-5'-diphosphatase activity is the result of an increased permeability of the membrane to <span class="GENE">IDP</span>. They are, however, consistent with the presence of a noncompetitive inhibitor of the enzyme in the microsomal membrane.</td></tr></table></div>

Male and female baby rats were sensitive to the inhibitory factor from normal rats. Contrary to the normal adult rat serum the whole hepatectomized adult rat serum did not exhibit any ingibitory activity on the G1-S transition. However, two components having antagonist activities: an alpha1 globulin and a gamma globulin, were separated by chromatographic procedures from hepatectomized rat serum. (a) The alpha1 globulin showed an inhibitory activity. It had an apparent molecular weight lower than that found in normal rats. Its activity was sex related: only male baby rats were responsive. (b) The factor present in the gamma globulin fraction was found to be antagonistic to the alpha1 globulin factor. Its occurrence after hepatectomy explains the absence of inhibitory activity in the serum of hepatectomized rats.</td></tr></table></div>

BALB/c x-ray-induced leukemia RL male 1 is strongly immunogenic for (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F1 mice. Transplants of RL male 1 regressed after initial growth, and after tumor regression mice could resist repeated inocula of 10(7) RL male 1 cells. Spleen cells from immunized mice after in vitro stimulation with RL male 1 were cytotoxic for RL male 1 cells in 3-hr 51Cr assays. Pretreatment of immune spleen cells with Thy-1, Lyt-2, or Lyt-3 antisera and complement eliminated cytotoxic activity, indicating that <span class="CHEMICAL">effector</span> cells for RL male 1 lysis are T cells. Tests with other target cells showed little or no cytotoxicity. Analysis of the specificity of T-cell killing of RL male 1 by competitive inhibition assays with unlabeled cells indicated that only RL male 1 could inhibit killing; other BALB/c tumors (13 x-ray or murine leukemia virus-induced leukemias and three myelomas) failed to inhibit lysis of RL male 1. A range of alloantisera and heteroantisera were tested for their capacity to block lytic activity in the absence of added complement. H-2d antisera and Lyt-2 and -3 antisera blocked lysis, the latter at the level of the <span class="CHEMICAL">effector</span> cell. Antisera to other cell surface alloantigens, murine leukemia virus-related antigens, and immunoglobulins did not block RL male 1 lysis. Thus, T cells from mice immunized against RL male 1 recognize an individually distinct or unique antigen that does not appear to be related to any of the serologically defined cell surface determinants of RL male 1. In its restriction to a single leukemia, the RL male 1 antigen resembles the individually distinct antigens of chemically induced tumors and other tumor types of rodents.</td></tr></table></div>

Prostatic samples were surgically removed from 7 patients suffering from benign prostatic hypertrophy. High-speed supernatants (cytosol) containing 20-25 mg of protein/ml were prepared. <span class="CHEMICAL">glycerol</span> gradient ultracentrifugations were performed, using cytosol labeled at 0 C with 2-5 nM 3H-17beta-hydroxy-androstan-3-one (androstanolone or dihydrotestosterone) alone, or in the presence of 50-250-fold excess of androstanolone, estradiol, or androstane-3alpha, 17beta-diol (androstanediol). Two high-affinity saturable binding components were observed. One binding component was the <span class="GENE">androgen receptor</span>. Its sedimentation coefficient was 8 S in low-salt medium. It had a high affinity for androstanolone. The binding of 3H-androstanolone was strongly completed by androstanolone itself, less by estradiol, and not by androstanediol. In one case, endogenous androstanolone found in the 8 S region of <span class="CHEMICAL">glycerol</span> gradients was measured by radioimmunoassay, and it was calculated that more than 90% of the cytosol receptor binding sites might be occupied by this steroid while the total binding capacity of the 8 S receptor was estimated to approximate 2.6 pmol of androstanolone/g of prostate. No testosterone was found in the receptor fraction. The second binding component was attributable, at least in part, to the sex steroid-binding plasma protein (SBP), as indicated by its sedimentation coefficient (congruent to 4 S in low salt medium), its high affinity for androstanolone and androstanediol and its lower affinity for estradiol, and finally, its migration on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In one instance, the concentration of the SBP-like protein in prostate cytosol was measured by equilibrium dialysis, and it was calculated that the binding capacity of the prostate SBP-like component corresponded to 4 pmol of androstanolone/g of prostate, a small (less than 5%) value with regard to SBP concentration in the plasma of the same patient. The blood contamination of the cytosol, as obtained from the measurement of hemoglobin, did not account for the amount of SBP found in the prostate sample. Since SBP-like protein is probably of plasma origin, to determine whether SBP was located in the extracellular space or inside the prostate cells, BPH slices from another patient were incubated in the presence of 3H-testosterone, the cytosol was prepared, and was fractionated by Sephadex G-150 column chromatography. The androstanolone/testosterone ratio in the receptor-containing peak was high (1.7), whereas in the incubation medium it was very low (0.08). In the peak containing the SBP-like protein, the ratio was 0.74, which may suggest that all or part had been exposed to the predominant androstanolone environment inside the prostatic cell.</td></tr></table></div>

In Tris-CHl containing 1 mm-NaF, stimulation of incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids by noradrenaline was enhanced by ATP, CaCl2, MgCl2 and CoA plus dithiothreitol. The optimum concentration of CaCl2 for stimulation by 10 mum-noradrenaline was 10 mum. In the presence of CaCl2, the optimum concentration of ATP-2MgCl2 was in the range 0.1-1 mm.

Psoriatic scale proteases were fractionated by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration and further by DEAE cellulose chromatography. Five different enzyme preparations were obtained. The first preparation, resembling cathepsin D, effectively hydrolysed hemoglobin at pH 3.5 and casein at pH 5.8 and was insensitive to protease modifiers. The second preparation effectively hydrolysed trypsin substrates (AGLME, TAME, BAEE and BANA) and also histone and casein at pH 7.2 and was inhibited by protease inhibitors, TLCK and E-600. The third preparation hydrolysed histone and casein at pH 10.2 and was effectively inhibited by E-600 and partially by protease inhibitors and TPCK. The fourth preparation, resembling cathepsin B1, hydrolysed BANA and BAEE at pH 5.8 and was activated by SH-reagents and EDTA. The fifth enzyme preparation hydrolysed ATEE and was inhibited by E-600 and TPCK. Plasminogen activator was found mainly in the second enzyme preparation and fibrinolysin activity in the third and fifth enzyme preparations. The second, third and fifth enzyme preparations were different from the enzymes found in healthy human skin.

Lesser, though significant, elevations were also found after subcutaneous injection of 25 mg of casein, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, or monomeric immunoglobulin G, whereas pyrogen-free human serum albumin/U.

The same patients after recovery from coma presented normal TSH and PRL, slightly elevated basal GH, and normal PRL but blunted TSH responses to TRH; in four of these patients, a clear-cut rise in GH (i.e. more than 10 ng/ml) occurred after <span class="GENE">TRH</span> administration. The depressive patients presented normal basal TSH and PRL, slightly elevated basal GH, and normal PRL but blunted TSH responses to TRH; in four of these patients, a moderated rise in GH (less than 10 ng/ml) occurred after <span class="GENE">TRH</span> administration. The increment in T3 concentrations 120 min after <span class="GENE">TRH</span> was found reduced in the comatose patients only.

Treatment of the enzyme with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine, a gamma-glutamyl analog, results in parallel loss of <span class="GENE">transpeptidase</span> and proteinase activities indicating that the site at which gamma-glutamylation of the enzyme occurs (presumably a hydroxyl group on the light subunit) is also involved in proteinase activity. The purified light subunit, but not the heavy subunit, exhibits proteinase activity even in the absence of urea. Results suggest that dissociation of the enzyme unmasks the proteinase activity of the light subunit involving the site at which gamma-glutamylation of the enzyme occurs, and that the heavy subunit may impose <span class="GENE">transpeptidase</span> reaction specificity by contributing the binding domains for gamma-glutamyl substrates.</td></tr></table></div>

Phthalate esters have shown to stimulate the latent ATPase [<span class="GENE">EC 3.6.1.3</span>] activity and induce mitochondrial swelling. Among the tested phthalate esters, di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) exhibited the greatest activity, and the activity decreased progressively as the alkyl chain was lengthened or shortened. The DBP-stimulated ATPase was oligomycin-sensitive. The degree of stimulation of the ATPase was proportional to the extent of mitochondrial swelling induced by DBP in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 0.25 M sucrose. However, the swelling was dependent on the tonicity of the solution or the concentration of <span class="CHEMICAL">chloride</span> ions, while the stimulation of ATPase was independent of these factors. Swelling was strongly induced by DBP at slightly acidic rather than neutral or alkaline pH. The pH-activity curve of DBP-stimulated ATPase was in inverse correlation with that of swelling, which showed a rather flat maximum at pH 8.0. When bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added to a solution containing mitochondria before addition of DBP, swelling was no longer caused by DBP, though the latent ATPase was stimulated to the same extent in the absence of added BSA.</td></tr></table></div>

The results suggest that the coupling reaction is strongly affected by the conformational changes linked to oxygenation of the protein.

In response to digitalis, <span class="GENE">OAP</span> occur in tissues of the specialized conducting systems of both ventricles and atria and, under the influence of tension, occasionally in ventricular myocardium. Digitalis, in toxic doses, suppresses "normal" pacemaker activity possibly in part by enhancing overdrive suppression. In contrast to "normal" pacemaker activity, <span class="GENE">OAP</span> exhibit, both in magnitude and rate of depolarization, postpacing acceleration. This plus the coupled nature of <span class="GENE">OAP</span> are important characteristics in the generation of complex arrhythmias by <span class="GENE">OAP</span>. Conduction disturbances may also be related to <span class="GENE">OAP</span>. At early stages of intoxication <span class="GENE">OAP</span> may speed conduction of superimposed beats relative to earlier or later beats. More advanced stages of intoxication are associated with conduction block. The occurrence of digitalis-induced <span class="GENE">OAP</span> is promoted by high concentrations of <span class="CHEMICAL">calcium</span>, low concentrations of potassium, and moderate stretch. <span class="GENE">OAP</span> can be suppressed by high concentrations of potassium, reduction of extracellular <span class="CHEMICAL">calcium</span>, and exposure to antiarrhythmic agents including diphenylhydantoin, verapamil, and aprindine. The effectiveness of the latter two agents may be related to ability to block transmembrane <span class="CHEMICAL">calcium</span> currents. Digitalis-induced <span class="GENE">OAP</span> in atrial tissue can be abolished by acetylcholine. A transmembrane current possibly but not necessarily carried by <span class="CHEMICAL">calcium</span> appears to underly the occurrence of <span class="GENE">OAP</span>. This current demonstrates kinetic properties different from those of the slow inward current associated with the plateau of the cardiac action potential. <span class="CHEMICAL">calcium</span> is intimately involved in the mechanism causing <span class="GENE">OAP</span> and may be responsible for aftercontractions observed in conjunction with <span class="GENE">OAP</span>. Aftercontractions greatly affect contractility and may be responsible at least in part for some of the inotropic actions of digitalis.

By exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-100 a molecular weight of 21 000 was estimated. The purified enzyme was most stable at pH 5.8 in potassium phosphate buffer, and at pH 4.5 in McIlvaine buffer. At high dilutions the enzyme was very labile and was remarkably stabilized by high salt concentrations. Enzyme activity is inhibited by native rat blood serum, iodoacetamide and leupeptin, but not by phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride, suggesting that it belongs to the class of thiol proteinases. Among various enzymes tested, only 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase was attacked by the inactivase to a similar extent to the <span class="GENE">pyruvate dehydrogenase complex</span>. Studies on the inactivation mechanism indicate that although the overall reaction is completely lost after treatment with inactivase, each individual step of the multienzyme complex retains full catalytic activity.

This lack of a phosphaturic response to <span class="CHEMICAL">parathyroid hormone</span> was not reversed by administration of 25-OH vitamin D or infusions of calcium or phosphate. <span class="GENE">calcitonin</span>, another potentially phosphaturic hormone, also vailed to increase phosphate excretion but markedly elevated urinary excretion of cyclic AMP. In hamsters pretreated with infusion of urinary ammonium chloride, which decreased plasma and urinary pH, both <span class="CHEMICAL">parathyroid hormone</span> and <span class="GENE">calcitonin</span> increased excretion of phosphate as well as that of cyclic AMP. Acetazolamide had no phosphaturic effect in ammonium chloride-loaded hamsters, and it decreased cyclic AMP and calcium excretion. Alkalinization of urine by acetazolamide did not prevent the phosphaturic effect of <span class="CHEMICAL">parathyroid hormone</span> in ammonium chloride-loaded hamsters, but it blocked the increase in urinary cyclic AMP excretion. <span class="CHEMICAL">parathyroid hormone</span> and <span class="GENE">calcitonin</span> both stimulated adenylate cyclase in a cell-free system (600-g pellet) from hamster renal cortex, elevated tissue cyclic AMP levels, and activated protein kinase in tissue slices from hamster renal cortex. In acid medium, the increase in cyclic AMP and activation of protein kinase in response to <span class="CHEMICAL">parathyroid hormone</span> was diminished, but addition of acetazolamide restored responsiveness of both parameters to control values. Acetazolamide, on the other hand, did not influence adenylate cyclase or its response to <span class="CHEMICAL">parathyroid hormone</span> or cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity. We conclude that the lack of a phosphaturic effect of <span class="CHEMICAL">parathyroid hormone</span> and <span class="GENE">calcitonin</span> in the hamster depends on steps in the cellular action of these hormones, steps that are sensitive to pH subsequent to cyclic AMP generation and protein kinase activation.

Thus, the hamster is a particularly useful model for studies of syndromes in which there is renal resistance to phosphaturic hormones.</td></tr></table></div>

The reaction requires, in addition to the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, all four ribonucleoside triphosphates and is inhibited by low concentrations of actinomycin D. Evidence is presented that the priming protein serves as a novel RNA polymerase to form a priming segment which is subsequently extended by <span class="GENE">t7 dna polymerase</span>. T7 RNA polymerase (gene 1-protein) can only partially substitute for the DNA-priming protein.

Detergent and papain solubilized murine histocompatibility (H-2) antigens have been compared by gel exclusion chromatography, ultracentrifugation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and amino-acid sequence analysis. From these data, we propose a molecular model for the H-2 antigens that includes the size and arrangement of the subunits on the cell surface and in solution, and we provide evidence for the orientation of these molecules on the cell surface. Detergent solubilized H-2 antigens (molecular weight 116,000) consist of two disulfide-linked heavy chains (46,000 daltons) and two monocovalently associated light chains (12,000 daltons). Alkylation with <span class="CHEMICAL">iodoacetamide</span> prior to extraction prevented the formation of a disulfide linkage between the two heavy chains. A water-soluble 51,000-dalton molecule (Fs) consisting of a 39,000-dalton fragment (FH) of the heavy chain and one intact light chain was obtained by papain digestion of cells or detergent extracts. Therefore, the disulfide linkage between the heavy chains is located in the remaining membrane-associated portion (Fm). Amino-acid sequence analysis of the FH fragment of H-2Kb by radiochemical techniques showed that it is identical to the detergent solubilized <span class="GENE">h-2kb heavy chain</span> in eight positions for the three amino acids tested. These data indicate that the fragment FH derives from the amino-terminus of the heavy chain and suggest that it projects outward from the cell surface, while the carboxyl-terminal region is associated with the plasma membrane. The described amino-terminal sequence data have been found constant in H-2Kb, H-2Kd, H-2Kk, H-2Db, and H-2Dd gene products. These data support the hypothesis that the K and D products of the major histocompatibility antigen complex have evolved by gene duplication.</td></tr></table></div>

Species <span class="GENE">IV</span> is produced when cells are grown in iron-deficient medium and is, therefore, probably deficient in the 2-methylthio modification of N-6-(delta-2-isopentenyl) adenosine. A new minor species (Va) also appears under those conditions. All of the new components elute earlier than the major normal species.

Thus, species <span class="GENE">IV</span> and V appear to be transcriptional products. Although E. coli 15T minus appears to be rel plus, starvation for methionine or cysteine leads to the accumulation of species <span class="GENE">IV</span> (without addition of chloramphenicol); rifampin blocks the accumulation. Species V is still produced on addition of chloramphenicol to starved cultures. Starvation for arginine or tryptophan does not alter the chromatographic profile from the normal case.

Oxalacetate (OAA) reversed lipoate-inhibited QO2 and QH+ of chambered mucosas by 70 and 40%, respectively. Pyruvate or glucose produced similar effects. Neither activity was affected by OAA when added after glucose, pyruvate, decanoate, butyrate, or lipoate-propionate-inhibited mucosa. Lipoate-treated or lipoate-propionate-treated mucosa did not respond to histamine; OAA addition prior to <span class="CHEMICAL">histamine</span> restored responsiveness.

A new, very sensitive, rapid and reliable assay for guanylate cyclase has been established based on conversion of [32P]GTP to [32P]guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate and its separation on Dowex 50 and aluminium oxide columns. The optimum conditions for the assay of mouse parotid guanylate cyclase have been established and using this procedure the properties of the enzyme have been investigated. The enzyme was found in both the particulate and supernatant fractions. The particulate enzyme was activated 12-fold by Triton X-100 and the supernatant enzyme activity increased 2-fold. In the presence of <span class="GENE">detergent guanylate cyclase</span> activity was distributed 85% in the particulate and 15% in the supernatant fractions, respectively. The particulate activity was localised in a plasma membrane fraction. Guanylate cyclase activity was also assayed in a wide variety of other tissues. In all cases enzymatic activity was found in both the particulate and supernatant fractions. The distribution varied with the tissue but only the intestinal mucosa had a greater proportion of total guanylate cyclase activity in the particulate fraction than the parotid. The two enzymes showed some similar properties. Their pH optima were pH 7.4, both enzymes were inhibited by ATP, dATP, dGTP and ITP, required Mn2+ for activity and plots of activity versus Mn2+ concentration were sigmoidal. However, in many properties the enzymes were dissimilar. The ratios of Mn2+ to GTP for optimum activity were 4 and 1.5 for the supernatant and plasma-bound enzymes, respectively. The slope of Hill plots for the supernatant enzyme with varying Mn2+ was 2. The particulate enzyme plots also had a slope of 2 at low Mn2+ concentration but at higher concentrations (above 0.7 mM) the Hill coefficient shifted abruptly to 4. <span class="CHEMICAL">calcium</span> ions reduced sigmoidicity of the kinetics lowering the Hill coefficient, activated the enzyme at all Mn2+ concentrations but had no effect on the Mn2+:GTP ratio with the supernatant enzyme while with the plasma membrane enzyme Ca2+ had no effect on the sigmoid form of the kinetics at low Mn2+ but prevented the shift to a greater Hill coefficient at higher Mn2+, inhibited the activity at low Mn2+ and shifted the Mn2+:GTP optimum ratio to 4. For the particulate enzyme plots of activity versus GTP concentration were sigmoid (n = 1.3), while the supernatant enzyme exhibited hyperbolic kinetics.</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='REGULATOR'><table><tr><td>Identification and characterization of a bile acid receptor in isolated liver surface membranes. It is generally assumed that hepatic transport of bile acids is a carrier-mediated process. However, the basic mechanisms by which these organic anions are translocated across the liver <span class="GENE">cell</span> surface membrane are not well understood. Since carrier-mediated transport involved binding of the transported molecule to specific receptor sites, we have investigated the possibility that bile acid receptors are present in liver surface membranes. Isolated liver surface membranes were incubated at 4 degrees C with [14C]cholic acid and [14C]taurocholic acid, and membrane-boudn bile acid was separated from free by a rapid ultrafiltration technique through glass-fiber filters. Specific bile acid binding is rapid and reversible and represents approximately 80% of the total bile acid bound to liver surface membranes. Taurocholic acid binding is independent of the medium pH, while cholic acid binding demonstrates an optimum at pH 6.0. Analysis of equilibrium data for both <span class="CHEMICAL">cholic and taurocholic acid</span> binding indicates that specific binding is saturable and consistent with Michaelis-Menten kinetics, while nonspecific binding is nonsaturable. Apparent maximal binding capacity and dissociation constant values indicate a large capacity system of receptors that have an affinity for bile acids comparable to that of the hepatic transport mechanism. Scatchard analysis of the saturation kinetics as well as inhibition studies suggest that bile acids bind to a single and noninteracting class of anion that competes with bile acids for hepatic uptake, also inhibits cholic acid binding. In contrast, no inhibition was demonstrated with indocyanine green and probenecid. Specific bile acid binding is enriched and primarily located in liver surface membranes and found only in tissues involved in bile acid transport. Specific bile acid binding is independnet of Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ and does not require metabolic energy. In addition, thiol groups and disulfide are not required for activity at the binding site. However, specific bile acid binding is markedly decreased by low concentrations of proteolytic enzymes and is also decreased by the action of neuraminidase and phospholipases A and C. These results are consistent with the existence of a homogeneous bile acid receptor protein in liver surface membranes. The primary surface membrane location of this receptor, its binding properties, and its ligand specificity suggest that bile acid binding to this receptor may represent the initial interaction in bile acid transport across liver surface membranes.</td></tr></table></div>

A number of <span class="CHEMICAL">acidic</span> dyes, including various fluorochromes, were substituted for biebrich scarlet in the modified Guard (1959) procedure, a regressive staining method which appears to demonstrate basic chromosomal proteins. These substitutions were made to test the possibility that dyes other than biebrich scarlet might provide advantages in sensitivity and/or contrast, or that more control could be exerted over the "differentiation" step in which solutions of phosphotungstic and phosphomolybdic acids (polyacids) are used. Of the dyes tested in this investigation, six were found to be especially suitable: procion brilliant blue, procion yellow, geranine G, brilliant sulfoflavine, eosin Y, and eosin B. While procion brilliant blue could be used as an absorption dye only, the other dyes were used more profitably as fluorochromes. The various dyes displayed considerable variability in the ease with which they could be displaced from substrates with polyacid solutions during the differentiation step. Procion brilliant blue, procion yellow, and geranine G were displaced gradually and thus resembled biebrich scarlet. In contrast, eosin B, eosin Y, and brilliant sulfoflavine were displaced more easily from all but the most highly condensed chromatin in substrates. Brilliant sulfoflavine yeilded exceptionally <span class="GENE">bright</span> and nearly selective fluorescence of consensed chromosomes in division, "X" chromosomes of grasshopper spermatocytes, and sperm heads. Weak, but selective fluorescence was observed when monazo sulfonated dyes, including ponta chrome violet SW, eriochrome black, diamond red, and ponta chrome blue black, were substituted in the modified Guard procedure. Similar results were obtained with solochrome cyanin R. As expected, these dyes seemed to function as weakly <span class="CHEMICAL">acidic</span> dyes.</td></tr></table></div>

Adenosine 5'-tetraphosphate (ATetP), ATP, ADP, AMP, guanosine 5'-tetraphosphate (GTetP) and GDP were found to inhibit soluble guanylate cyclase activity from rat lung and other mammalian tissues. The corresponding cytosine and thymine nucleotides showed little or no inhibitory activity, except for thymidine 5'-tetraphosphate, which inhibited glanylate cyclase activity but to a lesser extent than did the purine nucleoside tetraphosphates. ATetP and GTetP were found to be potent inhibitors of soluble guanylate cyclase activity from rat, guinea pig and mouse lung, rat heart and rat brain. Both purine nucleoside tetraphosphates were competitive inhibitors of the rat lung soluble enzyme. ATetP and GTetP had Ki values of 1 muM and 2.5 muM, respectively.

<div class='PRODUCT-OF'><table><tr><td>Control of 5-aminolaevulinate synthetase activity in Rhodopseudomonas spheroides. Rhodopseudomonas spheroides can grow in a defined medium with either light or oxygen as an energy source. Cells grown anaerobically or at very low oxygen tensions are rich in the photosynthetic pigment bacteriochlorophyll, whereas this pigment is virtually absent in cells grown under high oxygen tensions. Aminolaevulinate synthetase, the first enzyme on the pathway to bacteriochlorophyll, appears to play an important role in the control of bacteriochlorophyll synthesis. Thus, the enzyme has a high activity in extracts of pigmented cells and a low activity in extracts of non-pigmented cells. Further, oxygenation of a pigmented culture causes immediate cessation of pigment synthesis and produces a rapid fall in the activity of aminolaevulinate synthetase. This loss of activity appears to be due to the loss of an endogenous activator of the enzyme. Thus, pigmented cells contain cystine <span class="CHEMICAL">trisulphide</span>, which at muM concentrations is an activator of aminolaevulinate synthetase, while oxygenation causes a rapid fall in the cellular content of this <span class="CHEMICAL">trisulphide</span>. Cystathionase (<span class="GENE">EC 4.2.1.15</span>) extracted from pigmented cells can catalyse the formation of cystine <span class="CHEMICAL">trisulphide</span> from cystine, while rhodanese (EC 2.8.1.1) extracted from the same cells can catalyse the degradation of cystine <span class="CHEMICAL">trisulphide</span> in the presence of sulphite to form cystine and thiosulphate. It is proposed that the cellular content of cystine <span class="CHEMICAL">trisulphide</span> is controlled by changes in the levels of substrates for cystathionase and possibly rhodanese rather than changes in the amounts of these enzymes. Cystine <span class="CHEMICAL">trisulphide</span> controls the activity of aminolaevulinate synthetase by converting a low-activity form of the enzyme (b-form) into a high-activity form (a-form). The fall in aminolaevulinate synthetase activity on oxygenation appears to be the result of cessation of conversion of b-form into a-form, along with a conversion of a-form into b-form.

Unlike E. rubrifaciens, trans-eliminase is not released from Erwinia carotovora cells by osmotic shock treatment, but enzyme activity is detected in the culture medium. The release of the enzyme is reduced fivefold by the addition of dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate. The hypersensitive reaction in tobacco leaves was induced within 60 min after injection of less than 1 mug of purified E. rubrifaciens trans-eliminase. Single cells of tobacco in suspension culture are readily killed by the enzyme, whereas tobacco protoplasts remain unaffected when treated in the same manner. These results indicate that endopolygalacturonic acid trans-eliminase is a constitutive enzyme possibly located in the periplasmic space of the E. rubrifaciens cell and releases enzyme into the culture medium in the presence of substrate. The release of the enzyme in tobacco tissue and the trans-eliminative cleavage of plant cell wall components may be steps leading to hypersensitivity of the tobacco tissue.</td></tr></table></div>

This is in contrast to untreated hay fever patients in whom an increase or no change at all of cell sensitivity and specific IgE was observed in the pollen season. Immunotherapy, therefore, can prevent such an increase in the pollen season. The mechanism might be due to a depression of the IgE production. In untreated as well as in treated patients the cell sensitivity was found to be significantly correlated to the grass specific IgE determined by RAST but not to the total serum level of IgE estimated by RIST. It seems likely that the sensitivity would be useful for evaluating the degree of allergy in grass pollen hay fever patients treated or not treated with immunotherapy.</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='PRODUCT-OF'><table><tr><td>Isolation and properties of yeast mutants with highly efficient <span class="CHEMICAL">thymidylate</span> utilization. A screening procedure is presented which allows the isolation of yeast mutants (typ tir) with highly efficient utilization of exogenous deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate (5'-dTMP) (greater than 50%). Data are given concerning the phenomenon of 5'-dTMP utilization in general: (i) The ability of S. cerevisiae to incorporate exogenous 5'-dTMP was found to already to be a wild type feature of this yeast, i.e. apparently not to be due to any mutation such as typ, tup, tmp, per or tum. Consequently these mutations are interpreted as amplifiers of a pre-given wild type potency. So far eight stages of 5'-dTMP utilization were detected as classified by the optimal 5'-dTMP requirement, with 5'-dTMP biosynthesis blocked, of the corresponding mutant strains isolated. All of them fit well into a mathematical series of the type "2n x 1.5" (n = 0, 1, 2, ..., 11), where the product term for n = 11 represents the 5'-dTMP requirement (mug/ml) of the best 5'-dTMP utilizing wild type strain found. (ii) Amplification of the 5'-dTMP utilizing potency obviously is due to any genetically determined alteration of the yeast 5'-dTMP uptaking principle itself or of physiological processes accompanying the monophosphate's uptake. (iii) The functioning of 5'-dTMP uptake requires acidic (less than or equal to pH 6) conditions in the yeast cell's outer environment. (iv) Some yeast typ and typ tlr mutants were found to exhibit a more or less pronounced sensitivity towards exogenously offered 5'-dTMP. The response of a sensitive strain towards inhibitory concentrations of the nucleotide apparently is co-conditioned by the presence or absence of <span class="CHEMICAL">thymidylate</span> biosynthesis. With 5'-dTMP biosynthesis blocked the 5'-dTMP mediated inhibition is a permanent one and finally leads to the death of a cell. With a functioning <span class="CHEMICAL">thymidylate</span> biosynthesis, in contrast, the inhibition is only temporary. (v) Yeast typ or typ tlr strains were observed to dephosphorylate exogenous 5'-dTMP to thymidine due to a <span class="GENE">phosphatase</span> activity which cannot be eliminated at pH 7 + 70 mM inorganic phosphate conditions in the growth medium. This 5'-dTMP cleavage obviously occurs outside the cell and does not seem to be correlated both to the monophosphate's uptake and to the phenomenon of 5'-dTMP sensitivity. The destruction of 5'-dTMP does not disturb (5'-dTMP) DNA-specific labelling.</td></tr></table></div>

In this study some factors which alter the rates of entry of four amino acids (the important neurotransmitter precursors L-tyrosine and L-tryptophan, as well as L-phenylalanine and L-histidine) into the brain have been studied and the findings considered in relation to conditions in which the quantities of one or more of the monoamine neurotransmitters formed within the cerebral <span class="GENE">cells</span> may be either too large or too small. Thus too little neurotransmitter will be formed if competition between amino acids for the carriers transporting them into the cerebral <span class="GENE">cells</span> causes the exclusion of a large proportion of any of the <span class="CHEMICAL">aromatic amino acid</span> precursors from the brain. ,or example, L-tryptophan is partially excluded from the brain if a raised level of any one of several other amino acids is maintained in the circulation. Of these, L-phenylalanine inhibits the transport of L-tryptophan into the brain most effectively, while <span class="CHEMICAL">aromatic amino acid</span>s in general exclude L-tryptophan more effectively than do other neutral amino acids. Over-production of one or more of the monoamine neurotransmitters is likely to occur when there is too much of one of the <span class="CHEMICAL">aromatic amino acid</span> precursors in the brain <span class="GENE">cells</span> as a result of abnormally high uptake from the blood, or as a result of their release by an excessive breakdown of the protein within these <span class="GENE">cells</span>.

The present study reports of three kinds of experiments of unaffected primary rejection of xenogenous kidney transplanats in the close-related fox-dog species system. The issue is whether there is a relation between the amount of grafted parenchyma and the immune induced potency, that is whether the course of rejection of transplanted single kidneys (group I a) differs from the course after en-bloc transplantation of both kidneys (group I b). In group II alterations of blood chemism and behavior of humoral antibodies are followed in dogs to which a fox kidney was transplanted, while keeping their own functioning kidneys. This experiment is to give information whether the uremic syndrome influences the development of humoral immunity, and what changes of blood chemism may primarily be related to destruction of the graft, under the condition of absent uremia. Untreated graft recipients survived for 5,4 +/- 0,49 days (n = 5) when single kidneys were transplanted (group I a), and 5,2 +/- 0,75 days (n = 5) when both kidneys were grafted en-bloc (group I b). As to the rejecting reactions, both groups are almost equal: the increasing functional failure causes a fast increase of <span class="CHEMICAL">creatinine</span> and urea nitrogen; alkaline phosphatase and <span class="GENE">LDH</span> show distinct alterations, related to the progress of the graft's destruction. Decrease of albumin level and loss of cholinesterase activity indicate an impaired hepatic function as reaction to uremic intoxication. Gamma-globulins and leucocytes show alterations that can be related to non-specific inflammatory reactions. The immunologically specific initial lymphopenia suggests that after revascularization these cells migrate to the graft, and later react with antigenic structures of vascular endothelium and still later with those of the organ cells. Cytotoxic antibodies appear on the 4th postoperative day in increasing amount. Post mortem histologic examination shows round cell infiltrates in the vastly necrotic renal parenchyma.

The culture medium of Diplococcus pneumoniae contains enzymic activity that cleaves Galbeta1 leads to 3GalNAc from desialized human erythrocyte membrane glycoprotein. The enzyme was purified 180-fold by ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel filtration through a Sephadex G-200 column, and DEAE A-25 Sephadex chromatography.

Using glycopeptides obtained by trypsin digestion of human erythrocyte membrane glycoprotein as a substrate, a Km of 0.20 mM (on the basis of the amount of Galbeta1 leads to 3GalNAc residues) was obtained. So far, the enzyme appears to have a strict specificity for Galbeta1 leads to 3GalNAcalpha1 leads to Ser and <span class="CHEMICAL">thr</span> structures, because no oligosaccharides larger than trisaccharides were liberated from porcine submaxillary <span class="GENE">mucin</span>.</td></tr></table></div>

ADP and <span class="CHEMICAL">ATP</span> levels in gel-filtered platelets (GFP) were not significantly different from those in PRP. By transmission electron microscopy, GFP were indistinguishable from PRP. Gel filtration appears to be a highly satisfactory technique of separating platelets from plasma without modifying structure, function, or contents significantly. The roles of several crude protein fractions in platelet aggregation and aspirin's inhibition of aggregation were examined. Fraction I (mostly fibrinogen) enhanced collagen-induced aggregation of gel-filtered platelets; Fraction V (mostly albumin) was inhibitory. Fraction <span class="GENE">II</span> (mostly gamma-globulin) or gelatin had no significant effect. Aspirin added to gel-filtered platelets inhibited aggregation by 80%. The addition of mixtures of plasma proteins containing albumin increased albumin's inhibitory effect. Incubation of gel-filtered platelets with aspirin labeled in the carboxyl position resulted in no uptake of the label. In contrast, incubation with acetyl-labeled aspirin was followed by uptake of more than 2 X 10(6) acetyl groups per platelet in 1 minute. Incubation for 30 minutes resulted in a five- to sixfold further increase in uptake of the label. Aspirin can acetylate platelets and inhibit aggregation directly.

After the period of fasting there was a 33% decrease in lung protein content, but there was no change in DNA content. Exposure to any of the experimental diets resulted in a decrease in tissue total phospholipid and phosphatidylcholine content per lung, but not per unit lung protein. Similarly lung lavage phospholipid and phosphatidylcholine content was decreased by 25% after fasting when expressed per lung or per unit DNA, but not per unit protein.

<div class='PRODUCT-OF'><table><tr><td>Patterns of fatty acid release from endogenous substrates by human platelet homogenates and membranes. We describe a method for measuring the release of fatty acids from endogenous substrates of human platelet homogenates and membranes. The method depends on the availability of lipids whose fatty acids are odd-chained and therefore suitable as internal reference compounds that, at the time of lipid extraction, can be added to an incubation to permit subsequent quantification of the content of free fatty acids or fatty acids esterified to specific lipids. We found four types of lipolytic activities in human platelets. In homogenates at pH 4.0 a triglyceride lipase operated as shown by the synchrony of triglyceride degradation and release of glycerol and those fatty acids that are the predominant constituents of triglycerides. However, enough arachidonic acid was released at this pH level to suggest some phospholipid breakdown, since triglycerides hold relatively small amounts of this acid. With membranous preparations, in the alkaline pH range there were two peaks of fatty acid release with accompanying degradation of phospholipids. At pH 8.5, where release of the saturated acids, palmitic and <span class="CHEMICAL">stearic</span>, predominated, their sum was 3.5 times that of arachidonic acid. At pH 9.5 the release of palmitic and <span class="CHEMICAL">stearic</span> acids was only slightly below their peak values; however, the release of arachidonic acid nearly equaled the sum of the saturated acids. Linoleic acid was not released in representative amounts by those reactions that released arachidonic acid, despite the overwhelming propensity of both to be esterified at the 2-position of phospholipids. Pertinently, the choline phospholipids are linoleic-rich and the non-choline phospholipids linoleic-poor, while both have a generous endowment of arachidonic acid. With this in mind, we raise the possibility that the <span class="GENE">phospholipase a2</span> of human platelets is an endoenzyme because of its tendency to act on those phospholipids that are thought to comprise the inner layer of the cell membrane.</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='PRODUCT-OF'><table><tr><td>[Interaction between gastrointestinal hormones and endocrine regulation]. The vicinity of several hormone-producing glands as part of the anatomy of the intestinal tract and the resulting interaction has been confirmed by the discovery of hormonal factors of a specifically gastro-intestinal origin. Today we are mainly interested in the interaction between intermediary metabolism and incretory intestinal function; this is characterized by the joint action of conventional glandular hormones such as insulin and pancreatic <span class="CHEMICAL">glucagon</span> as well as by the incretion of diffuse intestinal organs, hormones such as secretin, pancreozymin, motilin, VIP and GIP. The latter are at present subject of active research with the object of discovering their physiological significance be it as tissue hormones or as humoral agents with a "long distance" impact; their role within pathophysiology is also of interest. GIP ("gastric inhibitory peptide"), apart form acting upon the intestinal tract, also causes a marked rise in insulin production; this GIP possibly is the factor responsible for the difference in glucose tolerance following i. v. or oral administration of glucose, something that scientists have been trying to discover for a long time. We have also endeavored to investigate <span class="GENE">somatostatin</span>. This substance was originally discovered as a hypothalamic factor with inhibitory action on growth hormone secretion; in the meantime, however, cells containing and possibly also producing <span class="GENE">somatostatin</span> have also been detected in the intestine and particularly in the islets of Langerhans (D-cells). Since <span class="GENE">somatostatin</span> inhibits insulin secretion and especially <span class="CHEMICAL">glucagon</span> release as well as the exretory functions of the stomach and of the pancreas, the significance of this hormone possibly is that of a tissue hormone with inhibitory action on adjacent cells. As factor inhibiting both endocrine and exocrine secretory processes it would combine these two complexes. The possible therapeutic significance of <span class="GENE">somatostatin</span> administration to diabetics would lie in the saving of insulin. A third sector of present-day research deals with the interaction between the calcium metabolism and the hormones involved as well as the intestine. We know that patients suffering from primary hyperparathyroidism are prone to contract stomach ulcers and pancreatitis; patients with a gastrinoma and a hyperfunction of the epithelial bodies suffer from a Zollinger-Ellison-sindrome and this again suggests association with endocrine polyadenomatosis (Wermer syndrome). The inhibitory action of the parathormone antagonist calcitonin on the exocrine functions of the intestinal tract, such as the acid secretion of the stomach and the enzyme secretion of the pancreas, have already given rise to some considerations and experiments relative to treatment. It is to be hoped that because of all the joint observations cited above there will be better intergration of research both from the aspect of gastro-enterology and endocrinology. This might hopefully elucidate some of the unresolved problems ranging from basic research to practical application.</td></tr></table></div>

No <span class="GENE">fibrin</span> strands were noted in platelet aggregates fixed at the completion of the second wave of LTI. Apyrase and PGE1 inhibited the rate of first but not that of second wave LTI. The results suggest that the release of platelet <span class="CHEMICAL">ADP</span> induced by thrombin primarily affects the first phase aggregation, and the second phase may result from interaction of thrombin-exposed platelets and polymerizing <span class="GENE">fibrin</span>. Thus, the blood coagulation mechanism may be directly involved in platelet aggregation.</td></tr></table></div>

The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy has been investigated in a two-stage devascularization model in the rat with portavacal shunt and hepatic artery ligation. There is a significant increase in brain octopamine and phenylethanolamine and a decrease in brain norepinephrine (NE) 6 to 9 hours after hepatic artery ligation. The depletion of <span class="GENE">NE</span> seems the sequel of diminished synthesis in the presence of an unaltered turnover rate, due to a blockade of tyrosine hydroxylase either by accumulation of false neurochemical transmitters or by phenylalanine. It is most marked in the cortex and midbrain. The high-energy phosphate compounds, ATP, phosphocreatine and glucose-6-phosphate are not diminished in hepatic coma, nor is glucose, indicating that other mechanism are involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic state by the increased <span class="CHEMICAL">ammonia</span> level. "intestinal sterilization" and total colectomy have no significant effect on the <span class="CHEMICAL">ammonia</span> level, but cause a decrease in the level or aromatic precursor amino acids in the plasma and brain, with normalization of the level of cerebral transmitters. These results permit the formulation of a unified concept of the hepatic coma syndrome and its clinical manifestations such as flapping tremor, the hyperdynamic cardiovascular state and the hepatorenal syndrome. Moreover, they form the basis for the introduction of a new therapeutic principle in the management of hepatic encephalopathy by L-dopa or modified amino acid solutions, which act by altering the central and peripheral neurotransmitters.</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='PRODUCT-OF'><table><tr><td>Resynthesis of creatine phosphate in human muscle after exercise in relation to intramuscular pH and availability of oxygen. After exhaustive exercise the muscular store of creatine phosphate (CP) is almost completely depleted. The resynthesis of CP during recovery normally occurs rapidly, but is totally inhibited if the local circulation to the muscle is occluded. The limiting factor for CP resynthesis which could be a low intramuscular pH or availability of oxygen has been investigated in the present study. Biopsies from musculis quadriceps femoris of man were analyzed for pH, ATP, ADP, CP, creatine, <span class="CHEMICAL">lactate</span> and pyruvate. It was shown that resynthesis of CP only occurs when the blood supply to the muscle is intact. From this it was concluded that the <span class="GENE">creatine kinase</span> reaction is at a steady state or at equilibrium during the period of recovery. The influence of oxygen on the resynthesis of CP was investigated by incubating muscle samples taken after a fatiguing isometric contraction in atmospheres of oxygen and nitrogen, respectively. During 15 min incubation in oxygen CP was resynthesized from a starting value of 4% to 68% of the normal value at rest. No resynthesis was observed when parallel muscle samples were incubated for the same time in nitrogen. It is suggested that the initial fast phase of CP resynthesis is limited by the availability of oxygen whereas the subsequent slow phase is limited by the hydrogen ion transport out from the muscle.</td></tr></table></div>

Biol. Chem. 242, 109-113). Similar activities were detected in Crithidia fasciculata, Crithidia oncopelti, the blood forms of Trypanosoma brucei, Trypansoma congolense and Trypanosoma lewisi and the blood, intracellular and culture forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, suggesting that all species synthesize at least some <span class="CHEMICAL">thymidylate</span> de novo. The properties of the activities in C. fasciculata and the three forms of T. cruzi were compared with those of the isofunctional bacterial and mammalian enzymes. The trypanosotamid enzyme was inhibited by Mg2+, was much more sensitive to mercaptoethanol, had higher apparent Km values for substrate (dUMP) and cofactor (tetrahydrofolate), had a higher apparent molecular weight and was markedly more sensitive to inhibition by suramin. It is, therefore a possible target for chemotherapeutic attack, either on its own or in combination with a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor. No evidence was obtained for the regulation of the trypanosomatid enzyme, either by its product, dTMP, or by dTDP or dTTp. This result agrees with previous studies which suggested that in trypanosomatids, the level of dTMP was regulated, at least in part, by a catabolic pathway consisting of a <span class="CHEMICAL">thymidylate</span> phosphatase and a thymidine phosphorylase which degraded the excess of dTMP to thymine.</td></tr></table></div>

Control daily excretion in five dogs averaged 64 meq for Na, 51 meq for K, 66 meq for Cl, and 17 meq for net H. Furosemide, 40 mg, in the drinking water 3 times daily was given for 4 days. On day 1 Na excretion averaged 128 meq, but thereafter was not significantly different from control levels. Over 4 days cumulative net H excretion increased 63.6 meq and plasma HCO3 rose 6.6 meq/liter. The same dogs were restudied by the same protocol except that, to obviate electrolyte depletion, NaCl and KCl were administered daily in quantities sufficient to replace urinary losses. All dogs remained in positive Na, K, and Cl balance. Body weight, hematocrit, <span class="GENE">plasma albumin</span>, creatinine, and plasma renin activity were unchanged, indicating the absence of electrolyte or volume depletion. Nonetheless, cumulative net H excretion increased 61.2 meq and plasma HCO3 increased 4.3 meq/liter. Two adrenalectomized dogs receiving steroid replacement showed similar changes in net H excretion and plasma HCO3. These experiments suggest that chronic furosemide administration may enhance H excretion and generate alkalosis even in the absence of volume or electrolyte depletion and without increased aldosterone secretion.</td></tr></table></div>

In contrast, luminal pH decreased in late proximal tubules, when benzolamide was microinfused into the same nephron segment. The decrease of luminal pH indicates inhibition of luminally active <span class="GENE">carbonic anhydrase</span>, leading to delayed buffering  of secreted <span class="CHEMICAL">hydrogen ion</span>s. The increase of luminal pH in late proximal tubules may be attributed to several factors including increased delivery of bicarbonate, impaired bicarbonate exit at the antiluminal membrane and decreased <span class="CHEMICAL">hydrogen ion</span> formation in the tubular cell due to inhibition of cellular <span class="GENE">carbonic anhydrase</span>.</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='PRODUCT-OF'><table><tr><td>Concanavalin A stimulates phospholipid methylation and phosphatidylserine decarboxylation in rat mast cells. When histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells is stimulated by concanavalin A, membrane phospholipids are methylated in the early stage of this process. Exogenously added phosphatidylserine enhances the concanavalin A-induced histamine release, and at the same time the <span class="GENE">lectin</span> markedly stimulates the decarboxylation and methylation of phosphatidylserine. Within minutes after the addition of concanavalin A to rat mast cells, the newly methylated phospholipids begin to disappear and an increased formation of <span class="CHEMICAL">lysophosphatidylcholine</span> is observed. When rat mast cells are treated with concanavalin A in the absence of Ca2+, phospholipid methylation is stimulated but no significant release of histamine is detected. The subsequent exposure of the pretreated cells to Ca2+ causes increased release of histamine and degradation of methylated phospholipids. The inhibition of either synthesis or degradation of methylated phospholipids results in the inhibition of histamine release. These observations suggest that the synthesis and degradation of methylated lipids are an intrinsic part of the biochemical mechanism that modulate histamine release from mast cells.</td></tr></table></div>

Drug addition to a suspension of liver <span class="GENE">cells</span> results in the rapid formation of the cytochrome P-450 (Fe3+)-substrate complex which in turn is followed by the appearance of other species with different spectral characteristics before steady state drug monooxygenation is achieved.

Both experimental models respond similarily to phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene pretreatment of the animals and to various of the wellknown inhibitors of drug metabolism. Except with liver <span class="GENE">cells</span> isolated from fasted, phenobarbital-treated rats, generation of cytosolic <span class="CHEMICAL">NADPH</span> seems sufficient to support optimal drug metabolism even in the absence of added substrates of intermediary metabolism.

These are readily excreted, whereas non-conjugated products, e.g. free phenols, tend to accumulate intracellularly. Cellular glucuronide formation is strongly inhibited by ethanol-presumably due to an unfavorable effect of the increased NADH/NAD+ ratio on the synthesis of uridine-5'-diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA). In contrast, low concentrations of ethanol have no, or only a slight stimulatory effect on the cytochrome P-450-linked step of drug metabolism and there are indications that the oxidation of low concentrations of ethanol is in fact stimulated by a facilitated reoxidation of cytosolic NADH occuring during drug monooxygenation.</td></tr></table></div>

Inclusion of the anti-oxidant diethyldithiocarbamate in the extraction medium preserved the enzymes during extraction. Primary amines inhibited competitively, and phenazine methosulfate non-competitively each of the eight dehydrogenases tested with the fluorimetric assay.

Penbutolol caused no change in fasting blood glucose level. Insulin o.1 IU per kg body weight i.v. reduced blood glucose concentration by approximately 50 per cent after 30 - 45 min, both before and during treatment with penbutolol.

<div class='PRODUCT-OF'><table><tr><td>Production, metabolism and possible functions of adenosine in brain tissue in situ. Adenosine and H+ may act synergistically to regulate cerebral blood flow because adenosine production is enhanced under various experimental conditions associated with an imbalance between oxygen supply and oxygen need. Direct application of adenosine dilates the pial vessels, but changes in cerebral vascular resistance are not observed when adenosine is infused intraarterially. This is because adenosine does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. The studies reported here show that in dogs the adenosine released into the interstitium is partly reincorporated into adenine nucleotides via an <span class="GENE">adenosine kinase</span> (EC 2.7.1.20) reaction (salvage pathway) and partly degraded to <span class="CHEMICAL">inosine</span> and hypoxanthine. However, in contrast to other tissues, the accumulation of iosine and hypoxanthine in brain tissue proceeds at a rate slower than that of adenosine because one of the degradative enzymes, namely purine-nucleoside phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.1) is located only in the vessel wall, which is not readily permeable to adenosine. Thus, the slow access of adenosine to its degradative enzymes delays the appearance of its products, <span class="CHEMICAL">inosine</span> and hypoxanthine.</td></tr></table></div>

The intramitochondrially located phosphate-dependent glutaminase pathway is generally believed to be of primary importance. Adaptation involved either enhanced glutamine entry into the mitrochondria and/or activation of phosphate-dependent glutaminase, but the relative importance of each has not been resolved definitively. The overall adaptive response is probably modulated by factors regulating alpha-ketoglutarate metabolism to <span class="CHEMICAL">phosphoenolpyruvate</span>, and possibly also by metabolism of TCA cycle intermediates. It seems unlikely that a decrease in systemic pH is the direct effector for the acidosis-induced increase in ammonia formation; however, the resulting decrease in urine pH may play a critical role.

<div class='PRODUCT-OF'><table><tr><td>Reactions of the Neurospora crassa nitrate reductase with NAD(P) analogs. The assimilatory NADPH-nitrate reductase (NADPH:nitrate oxidoreductase, EC 1.6.6.3) from Neurospora crassa is competitively inhibited by 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide (AAD) and 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (AADP) which are structural analogs of NAD and NADP, respectively. The amino group of the pyridine ring of AAD(P) can react with nitrous acid to yield the diazonium derivative which may covalently bind at the NAD(P) site. As a result of covalent attachment, diazotized AAD(P) causes time-dependent irreversible inactivation of nitrate reductase. However, only the NADPH-dependent activities of the nitrate reductase, i.e. the overall NADPH-nitrate reductase and the NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activities, are inactivated. The reduced methyl viologen- and reduced FAD-nitrate reductase activities which do not utilize NADPH are not inhibited. This inactivation by diazotized AADP is prevented by 1 mM NADP. The inclusion of 1 muM FAD can also prevent inactivation, but the FAD effect differs from the NADP protection in that even after removal of the exogenous FAD by extensive dialysis or Sephadex G-25 filtration chromatography, the enzyme is still protected against inactivation. The FAD-generated protected form of nitrate reductase could again be inactivated if the enzyme was treated with NADPH, dialyzed to remove the NADPH, and then exposed to diazotized AADP. When NADP was substituted for NADPH in this experiment, the enzyme remained in the FAD-protected state. Difference spectra of the inactivated nitrate reductase demonstrated the presence of bound AADP, and titration of the sulfhydryl groups of the inactivated enzyme revealed that a loss of accessible sulfhydryls had occurred. The hypothesis generated by these experiments is that diazotized AADP binds at the NADPH site on nitrate reductase and reacts with a functional sulfhydryl at the site. FAD protects the enzyme against inactivation by modifying the sulfhydryl. Since NADPH reverses this protection, it appears the modifications occurring are oxidation-reduction reactions. On the basis of these results, the physiological electron flow in the nitrate reductase is postulated to be from NADPH via sulfhydryls to FAD and then the remainder of the electron carriers as follows: NADPH leads to -SH leads to FAD leads to <span class="GENE">cytochrome b-557</span> leads to Mo leads to <span class="CHEMICAL">NO-3</span>.</td></tr></table></div>

Stimulation by a K+ diffusion potential. Addition of valinomycin, nonactin, or monactin plus KCl in the dark to preilluminated chromatophores induced the synthesis of a large amount of ATP. This stimulation of postillumination ATP synthesis by a dark-imposed K+ diffusion potential was different from the stimulation caused by addition of permeant anions or cations in the light, since it increases when the pH of the light stage decreased from 8.0 to 6.0. It was thus most pronounced when the chromatophores were preloaded with protons but the light-induced proton concentration gradient (deltapH) was low. Imposition of a Kplus diffusion potential resulted however in stimulation of ATP synthesis even when the light-induced deltapH was already above the threshold value required to initiate postillumination ATP synthesis. This situation was realized when valinomycin plus KCl were added in the dark to chromatophores preilluminated above pH 6.7 with thiocyanate as the permeant anion, and the amount of ATP formed was the sum of the yields obtained with each of these affectors by itself. On the other hand addition of thiocyanate together with valinomycin plus KCl in the dark led to inhibition of ATP synthesis. In this case the permeant anion could not affect the light-induced deltapH but it did eliminate the diffusion potential by decreasing the difference between the permeabilities of Kplus and the anion present in the reaction mixture.</td></tr></table></div>

When given in equipotent beta1 blocking doses, the nonselective blocker propranolol and the beta1 selective blocker metoprolol differ markedly as regards inhibition of adrenaline induced beta2 mediated vasodilatation.

After propranolol, adrenaline therefore elicits a haemodynamic effect pattern characterized by high peripheral vascular resistance, high arterial blood pressure, low cardiac output and increased cardiac size. In view of these findings it is suggested that a beta1 selective blocker may be a more efficient antianginal agent than a nonselective blocker in those patients in which the anginal attack is associated with a significant release of adrenaline.

On the other hand, a shift from a polygonal to a spindle-shaped morphology is a accompanied by a significant decrease in both form factor and average optical density (AOD) of intact cell and nuclei, which are the most conspicuous measured changes caused by B2cAMP, in addition to a lengthening of the cell cycle duration. In both control and treated cells, important and parallel cell-cycle-dependent modulations of geometric and densitometric parameters are also observed, for both the cytoplasmic (i.e., cell morphometry) and DNA space (i e., nuclear morphometry). Specifically, the modulation in nulear morphometry during G1, S, <span class="GENE">G2</span>, and M phases confirms previous findings on synchronized HeLa cells.

Systematic analysis of the hydrolysis of benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)-dipeptides by cathepsin A [EC 3.4.12.1] purified from rat liver lysosomes showed that multiple forms of cathepsin A preferentially cleave peptide bonds with leucine, methionine, and phenylalanine. Cbz-Met-Met, -Met-Phe, -Phe-Met, and -Phe-Ala were hydrolyzed 6 to 8 times faster than the standard substrates, Cbz-Glu-Phe and Cbz-Glu-Tyr. The pH optima of the hydrolyses were 4.6 to 5.8. Hydrolysis of peptide bonds with glycine, isoleucine, and proline was very slow, but the rate depended on the nature of the adjacent amino acids. Proteins such as albumin, cytochrome c, gamma-globulin, hemoglobin, histone, myoglobin, and myosin were scarecely degraded. Peptide hormones, such as glucagon and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were hydrolyzed markedly with optimum pH's of 4.5 and 4.6, respectively. Angiotensin I, II, bradykinin, Lys- and Met-Lysbradykinin (kallidin and Met-kallidin), and substance P were also hydrolyzed at appreciable rates. pH optima for these peptide hormones were 5.2 to 5.6. On the other hand, insulin and its A chain, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH), oxytocin and <span class="CHEMICAL">vasopressin</span> were cleaved slowly. In the hydrolyses of glucagon and other peptides, multiple forms of rat liver lysosomal cathepsin A again showed a <span class="GENE">carboxypeptidase</span> nature, cleaving peptide bonds sequentially from the carboxyl terminal.

Serum IgE levels were significantly higher in the patients but total histamine content of about 10(7) leukocytes was not. Deuterium oxide (D2O) greatly increased histamine release (in both groups), indicating that the anti-IgE interacted with the basophils of urticaria patients. Passive sensitization of leukocytes with biologically active IgE was achieved in both patients and control subjects whose cells responded to anti-IgE, but was not achieved in either patients or control subjects whose cells were nonresponsive to anti-IgE challenge. 125I-anti-IgE autoradiographic studies revealed no obvious quantitative abnormality in the amount of basophil-bound IgE in chronic urticaria patients. Ionophore stimulation of aliquots of the same leukocytes used for anti-IgE challenge demonstrated that the urticaria patients' basophils were capable of releasing normal amounts of histamine. Leukocyte <span class="CHEMICAL">cyclic amp</span> levels in the two groups were not significantly different either in base-line levels or in responsiveness to stimulation with isoproterenol. These data indicate that chronic urticaria patients have a (acquired?) defect in leukocyte histamine release that occurs after the anti-IgE-IgE interaction, but before the actual (second-stage) release process, and that is comparable to the phenomenon of desensitization.</td></tr></table></div>

A study was implemented to quantitate the hydrolase and transgalactosylase activities of beta-galactosidase (E. coli) with lactose as the substrate and to investigate various factors which affect these activities. At low lactose concentrations the rate of galactose production was equal to the rate of glucose production. The rate of galactose production relative to glucose, however, dropped dramatically at lactose concentrations higher than 0.05 M and production of trisaccharides and tetrasaccharides began (galactose/glucose ratios of about 2:1 and 3:1, respectively, were found for these two types of oligosaccharides). At least five different trissacharides were formed and their patterns of formation showed that they probably utilized both lactose and allolactose as <span class="CHEMICAL">galactosyl acceptors</span>. Allolactose was produced in amounts proportional to glucose at all lactose concentrations (ratios of allolactose/glucose were about 0.88). Analyses of various data, including a reaction analyzed at very early times, showed that the major means of production of allolactose (and the only means initially) was the direct enzymatic transfer of galactose from the 4 position to the 6 position of the glucose moiety of lactose without prior release of glucose from the <span class="GENE">enzyme</span>. It was shown, however, that allolactose could also be formed in significant quantities by the transfer of galactose to the 6 position of free glucose, and also by hydrolysis of preformed trisaccharide. A mechanism which fits the initial velocity data was proposed in which the steps involving the formation of an enzyme-gallactose-glucose complex, the formation and breakage of allolactose on the <span class="GENE">enzyme</span>, and the release of glucose all seem to be of roughly equal magnitude and rate determining. Various factors affected the amounts of transgalactosylase and hydrolase activities occurring. At high pH values (greater than 7.8) the transgalactosylase/hydrolyase activity ratio increased dramatically while it decreased at low pH values (less than 6.0). At mid pH values the ratio was essentially constant. The absence of Mg2+ caused a large decrease in the transgalactosylase/hydrolase activity ratio while the absence of all but traces of Na+ or K+ had no effect.

Subcoma doses of fatty acids and ammonium salts injected intraperitoneally at the same time into rats or cats act synergistically to produce coma. Under these circumstances, the blood ammonia, is more than double that when the NH4+ is given alone. After these observations a rat liver homogenate system was utilized to study the effect of fatty acids on ammonia utilization in urea, <span class="CHEMICAL">glutamate</span> and glutamine synthesis in vitro. Acetylglutamate-catalyzed urea synthesis was completely inhibited by 45 mM octanoate and was depressed 46% by 9.5 mM octanoate. Citrulline synthesis was similarly inhibited 86 and 28%, respectively. The concentration of liver octanoate at the moment of occurrence of coma after an in vivo injection was approximately 10 mM. The inhibitory effect of fatty acids on the utilization of NH4+ in the urea cycle was greater the longer the fatty acid chain. The critical step in this interference with ammonia metabolism was the inhibition of carbamyl phosphate synthetase. Argininosuccinate synthetase activity was also inhibited to a lesser degree, but ornithine transcarbamylase, <span class="GENE">argininosuccinate lyase</span> and arginase were unaffected. <span class="CHEMICAL">glutamate</span> dehydrogenase was likewise inhibited in liver (83%) and brain (43%) by 13 mM octanoate, whereas glutamine synthetase was unaffected.

<div class='PRODUCT-OF'><table><tr><td>Presence of Escherichia coli of a deaminase and a <span class="GENE">reductase</span> involved in biosynthesis of <span class="CHEMICAL">riboflavin</span>. Two enzymes have been partially purified from extracts of Escherchia coli B which together catalyze the conversion of the product of the action of GTP cyclohydrolase II, 2,5-diamino-6-oxy-4-(5'-phosphoribosylamine)pyrimidine, to 5-amino-2,6-dioxy-4-(5'-phosphoribitylamine)pyrimidine. These two compounds are currently thought to be intermediates in the biosynthesis of <span class="CHEMICAL">riboflavin</span>. The enzymatic conversion occurs in two steps. The product of the action of GTP cyclohydrolase II first undergoes hydrolytic deamination at carbon 2 of the ring, followed by reduction of the ribosylamino group to a ribitylamino group. The enzyme which catalyzes the first step, herein called the "deaminase," has been purified 200-fold. The activity was assayed by detecting the conversion of the product of the reaction catalyzed by GTP cyclohydrolase II to a compound which reacts with butanedione to form 6,7-dimethyllumazine. The enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 80,000 and a pH optimum of 9.1. The dephosphorylated form of the substrate is not deaminated in the presence of the enzyme. The assay for the enzyme which catalyzes the second step, referred to here as the "reductase," involves the detection of the conversion of the product of the deaminase-catalyzed reaction to a compound which, after treatment with alkaline phosphatase, reacts with butanedione to form 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine. The <span class="GENE">reductase</span> has a molecular weight of approximately 40,000 and a pH optimum of 7.5. Like the deaminase, the <span class="GENE">reductase</span> does not act on the dephosphorylated form of its substrate.

A localized, transplantable testicular tumor of the Fischer rat regularly produces hypercalcemia and increased phosphorus clearance in host animals. Light and electron microscopic examinations of the tumor indicate that it is of Leydig origin. There is no evidence that the tumor secretes any biologically active sex steroids, judges by weights of target tissues, when the tumor is grown in castrated or spayed rats. No radioactive steroid hormone formation in vitro was detected using 1-14C-acetate as a precursor although 14C was incorporated into the "C27" <span class="CHEMICAL">sterol</span> fraction. Mass (micrograms) amounts of sex steroids were not detected after purifying large amounts of tumor extracts. The phytosterols, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, were tentatively identified in tumor extracts but were also found in other tissues and in tumors not associated with hypercalcemia. Administered in vivo, <span class="GENE">human chorionic gonadotropin</span> caused an acute rise in serum calcium in 3 to 5 hours in tumor-bearing hypercalcemic rats. Only trophic hormones with luteinizing hormone activity were found to compete with 125I-<span class="GENE">human chorionic gonadotropin</span> for binding to the tumor homogenate in vitro indicating the tumor possessed luteinizing hormone receptors. When the tumor was transplanted intrasplenically, hypercalcemia did not occur unless adhesions formed, suggesting that the tumor hormone was rapidly metabolized by the liver and was probably of small molecular weight. Secretory granules, usually thought to be associated with peptide hormone secretion, were not detected at the ultrastructure level. Cortisol, conjugated estrogen, and an inhibitor of <span class="CHEMICAL">sterol</span> biosynthesis (AY-9944) were effective in lowering the elevated serum calcium. Definitive identification of the agent causing lethal hypercalcemia has not been accomplished. The available data suggest it is not parathyroid hormone or vitamin D. The Leydig cell origin of the tumor, its response to <span class="GENE">human chorionic gonadotropin</span> in vivo, the lack of secretory granules at the ultrastructural level, and biologic characteristics, all lead to the speculation that the secretory product of the tumor is a new hormonal substance, possibly a steroid precursor or related substance not previously described or is a known substance of small molecular weight whose calcium-mobilizing properties have not been fully characterized. This transplantable tumor may represent a model for one form of neoplastic hypercalcemia occurring in man and may have important implications in the general area of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis.</td></tr></table></div>

In the 1st experiment, the low dose of TRH (0.077 microgram/min) had no effect on any hormone levels measured. Plasma TSH concentration increased significantly (p less than 0.05) in response to TRH infusion (0.77 microgram/min) in both experiments, but plasma TSH levels plateaued and then declined in both cases despite continued TRH infusion and irrespective of the presence or absence of a thyroid gland. A similar pattern of secretion, though less markedly decreased over time, was observed for plasma Prl in both experiments. The higher dose (0.77 microgram/min) of TRH had no effect on plasma GH concentration in the 1st infusion, but did result in a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in overall mean concentration of GH in both normal and THYX calves in the 2nd experiment. Removal of the thyroid gland, thus removing the source of increasing T4 and T3 levels seen in normal calves infused with TRH, failed to alter the secretory patterns of TSH and Prl. These data suggest that feedback inhibition by increasing plasma thyroid hormone concentrations was not responsible for the failure of TSH and, to a lesser extent, Prl to maintain chronically elevated plasma levels in response to continuous 24-h TRH infusion. It is suggested that a depletion of pituitary TSH and Prl stores readily secretable in response to a constant dosage level of TRH may be responsible for the secretory patterns observed.</td></tr></table></div>

This activation was prevented with KCN or glutathione, inhibitors of superoxide dismutase. Guanylate cyclase preparations formed superoxide ion. Activation by superoxide dismutase was further enhanced by the addition of nitrate reductase. Although guanylate cyclase activity was much greater with Mn2+ than with Mg2+ as sole cation cofactor, activation with superoxide dismutase was not observed when Mn2+ was included in incubations. Catalase also decreased the activation induced with superoxide dismutase. Thus, activation required the formation of both superoxide ion and H2O2 in incubations. Activation of guanylate cyclase could not be achieved by the addition of H2O2 alone. Scavengers of hydroxyl radicals prevented the activation.

In the absence of malate the treatment approximately doubled the rate of acylcarnitine oxidation. In normal mitochondria the acetyl groups consisted almost totally of ketone bodies. The clofibrate-induced increase in acetyl group production was attributable to enhanced rates of ketone body and <span class="CHEMICAL">acetylcarnitine</span> formation. The observed increase in acylcarnitine oxidation was associated with an elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate: acetoacetate ratio, reflecting an increased mitochondrial NADH:NAD+ ratio. In normal mitochondria the addition of malate in the presence of fluorocitrate doubled the rate of beta oxidation by forming citrate. The beta oxidation in mitochondria from clofibrate-treated rats was virtually unresponsive to added malate. The clofibrate-induced increase in ketogenesis was confirmed in disintegrated mitochondria. The treatment approximately doubled the rate of ketone body production from acetyl-CoA in disrupted organelles. The enhanced capacity of ketogenesis was accompanied by increased activity of the specific acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.8), which is the first step enzyme of the pathway.

Compared with the liver, a high activity of <span class="GENE">pyruvate kinase</span> was found in the placenta, indicating a high glycolytic potential; a small capacity for gluconeogenesis was also present and a moderate to low activity of enzymes associated with lipogenesis. The activity of all placental enzymes fell from day 15 to 20 of gestation irrespective of the pathway they represented. The pattern of decline continued when the gestation was prolonged up to day 26 by the administration of chorionic gonadotropin. The rates of activity disappearance over 11 days of gestation differed for each enzyme, with half-lives ranging from 2.7 days for NADP-malate dehydrogenase to 7 days for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. In contrast, the activity of hepatic enzymes either remained unchanged or showed individual adaptation to the advancing pregnancy. The regression in placental metabolic capacity after day 15 of gestation was also evident by the decrease in glucose uptake and its channelling to lactate, CO2, glycerol and <span class="CHEMICAL">fatty acids</span>. In addition, placental ageing was associated with triglyceride accumulation, mainly due to the decrease in free fatty acid oxidation. Treatment of pregnant rats with several hormones, while markedly affecting the hepatic enzyme activities, failed to induce appreciable changes in the corresponding placental enzymes. This was illustrated in the case of triiodothyronine treatment. Similarly, insulin deficiency induced by streptozotocin failed to elicit adaptive changes in placental enzyme activities typical of diabetes like those occurring in the maternal liver; some converse responses in the placenta were attributed to hyperglycaemia. On the other hand, responses in some fetal liver enzymes were suggestive of fetal hyperinsulinaemia. These observations indicate that placental enzymes are not susceptible to endocrine regulation and imply that placental metabolism is largely independent of the physiopathological alterations affecting the maternal organism. The gradual activity decreases with gestation suggest that the enzyme complement of the placenta, once developed, is designed to last through its limited lifespan without continuous replenishment. Within this context, no mechanism seems to operate to ind1ce the adaptive synthesis of individual enzymes, and the age of the placenta appears to be the primary factor determining its enzyme activity and metabolic performance.</td></tr></table></div>

These properties include pKa of fluorescence quenching, electrophoretic mobility at pH 5.0, stability to storage, and reduction by NaBH4. Proof for 8alpha substitution is shown by the electron paramagnetic resonance and electron-nuclear double resonance spectra of the cationic semiquinone form, as well as by the proton magnetic resonance spectrum of the oxidized form. The site of histidine substitution by the 8alpha-methylene of the flavin moiety was shown by methylation of the imidazole ring with methyl iodide, cleavage of the methylhistidine-flavin bond by acid hydrolysis at 150 degrees C, and identification of the methylhistidine isomer by electrophoresis. 3-Methylhistidine is the product from the N1-histidylflavin isomer, while 1-methylhistidine is produced from the N3 isomer. The flavin product from reductive Zn cleavage of either isomer has been identified as riboflavin. The compound obtained on acid treatment of 8alpha-(N3-histidyl)riboflavin (previously thought to be the N1 isomer) differs from the parent compound only in the ribityl side chain, since chemical degradation studies show 1-methylhistidine as a product and a flavin product which differs from riboflavin only in mobility in thin-layer chromatography, but not in absorption, fluorescence, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectral properties. Proof that acid modification involves only the ribityl chain has come from the observations that alkaline irradiation of this flavin yields <span class="CHEMICAL">lumiflavin</span>, that the proton magnetic resonance spectrum of the compound differs from that of riboflavin in the region of the ribityl proton resonance, and that its periodate titer is lower than that of authentic riboflavin.

A small amount of Hatchett's brown (cupric ferrocyanide, Cu2Fe(CN)6-7 H2O) formed at the subcellular sites of copper capture is then utilized as a heterogeneous catalyst to effect the oxidative polymerization of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine which results in the formation of an insoluble, highly colored osmiophilic <span class="CHEMICAL">indamine</span> polymer at the sites of enzymatic activity.

The K1 decreased by approx. 20-fold for each pair of methylenes added to the chain length, showing that the initial stage in inhibitor binding occurs at a non-polar region of the protein. This region is probably located at the <span class="GENE">enzyme</span> active site, since inhibition was prevented by acetoacetyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA but not by CoA. The site of modification by chloromethyl ketone derivatives of fatty acids is restricted to a thiol group, since inactivation of the <span class="GENE">enzyme</span> was prevented by reversible thiomethylation of the active-site thiol. In contrast, an amino-directed reagent, citraconic anhydride, still inactivated the <span class="GENE">enzyme</span>, even when the active-site thiol was protected. Evidence that the <span class="GENE">enzyme</span> thiol was particularly reactive came from studies on the pH-dependence of the alkylation reaction and thiol-competition experiments. Inhibition of the <span class="GENE">enzyme</span> proceeded suprisingly well at acidic pH values and a 10(5) molar excess of external thiol over active-site thiol was required to prevent inhibition by 0.3 mM-9-chloro-8-oxononanoic acid.

A corollary to this conclusion is that the fatty acid hydroperoxide (HPETE) formed by lipoxygenase from arachidonic acid may also augment the release of anaphylactic mediators.

The unpurified, detergent-dispersed enzyme also migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 182,000 on columns equilibrated with 0.5% Lubrol WX and 0.1 M NaCl, but it migrated as a large aggregate (molecular weight is greater than 5 X 10(5)) on columns equilibrated in the absence of either the detergent of NaCl. After gel filtration, the unpurified, dispersed enzyme still yielded positive cooperative kinetic patterns as a function of MnGTP.

To study this, reconstituted chick bone <span class="GENE">collagen</span> fibrils were incubated in vitro with highly purified lysyl oxidase and D-penicillamine. As reported in previous studies in vivo, allysine content increased and polyfunctional cross-link synthesis decreased with D-penicillamine. However, the concentration of bifunctional cross-links increased rather than decreased due to a 2-fold increase in N6:6'-dehydro-5,5'-dihydroxylysinonorleucine. Hydroxyallysine, an intermediate in formation of this Schiff base, decreased. A time study indicated that allysine levels increased primarily after the bulk of Schiff base synthesis. These results indicate that D-penicillamine does not inhibit bifunctional cross-link synthesis as previously suggested. Its principal effect is to block synthesis of polyfunctional cross-link products from Schiff base cross-link precursors and to cause accumulation of these precursors. This effect may be due to interference with the close molecular packing required for polyfunctional cross-link synthesis. These results also suggest a mechanism for the relative insensitivity of tissues such as bone with high hydroxylysine content to D-penicillamine. In this study, D-penicillamine caused selective accumulation of allysyl and not hydroxyallysyl residues. In bone as opposed to soft tissues, hydroxyallysyl residues are intermediates in synthesis of almost all cross-links.</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='PRODUCT-OF'><table><tr><td>The role of microsomal cytochrome b5 in the metabolism of ethanol, drugs and the desaturation of fatty acids. Liver endoplasmic membrane contains two hemoproteins, cyt. P-450 and cyt. b5. Cytochrome P-450 catalyzes the hydroxylation of lipid-soluble compounds, while the cyt. b5 system is involved in desaturation of fatty acids. NAD(P)H and <span class="CHEMICAL">oxygen</span> are essential components for both systems. Oxidation of ethanol to acetate in the liver, via alcohol and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases, leads to an elevated cellular NADH content. It has been proposed that oxidation of the cytosolic NADH occurs predominantly in the mitochondria via the substrate oxidation-reduction shuttle. In order to investigate the effects of elevated levels of cytosolic NADH on the state of the endoplasmic hemoprotein system, microsomes from a fatty human liver (post-ethanol intake) were isolated and studied. Microsomal cyt. b5 reductase was found to reoxidize cytoplasmic NADH directly and transfer the reducing equivalents readily to the microsomal oxidases. Addition of catalytic amounts of alcohol dehydrogenase, NAD, and ethanol to microsomes resulted in a rapid reduction of microsomal cyt. b5. These results are consistent with the proposal that the catalytic moiety of cyt. b5 reductase is exposed to the aqueous phase of the membrane and directly accepts reducing equivalents from the cytoplasm. Microsomes from fatty human liver showed an increased rate of cyt. b5 dependent desaturation of fatty acids. These findings suggest that ethanol metabolism may selectively affect the activity of one or the other microsomal hemoprotein. Thus, when the <span class="GENE">desaturase</span> activity is low, drug metabolism by the cyt. P-450 pathway may predominate. Conversely, an increase in the <span class="GENE">desaturase</span> level may lead to a decreased drug metabolism.

An LD50 of 125 mug/kg for a neutral solution of AcHC-3 was decreased to 78.3 mug/kg (the LD50 of HC-3) upon being made basic. Prolonged treatment of mice with LD10-20 doses of AcHC-3 was associated with decreased fatty acid oxidation in the liver and resulted in infiltration of fat into hepatic cells, a reaction preventable by treatment with small doses of choline (10 mg/kg). AcHC-3 causes neuromuscular and autonomic ganglionic blockade, <span class="GENE">cholinesterase</span> inhibition, and in vitro inhibition of acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis. These actions, although HC-3-like, appear to be due to AcHC-3 rather than HC-3 since neither <span class="GENE">cholinesterase</span> inhibition nor hepatic ligation altered the neuromuscular blocking actions of AcHC-3. In addition to its HC-3-like properties, AcHC-3 consistently produced a transient increase in twitch height of gastrocnemius muscle before blockade and was dose-responsive in depressing blood pressure and in eliciting contractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum. AcHC-3 is both a cholinomimetic (depresses arterial blood pressure, decreases heart rate and increases ileal contractions) and a competitor of acetylcholine. That is, in most preparations tested, AcHC-3 at lower concentrations has as much intrinsic activity as ACh and at somewhat higher concentrations competitively blocks the responses to ACh. These cholinomimetic actions may be due to the presence of two ACh moieties on the AcHC-3 molecule which attach to cholinergic receptor sites.

This report describes macromolecules that bind (des-aspartic acid1)-<span class="GENE">angiotensin i</span>I, the des aspartic acid1 derivative of <span class="GENE">angiotensin i</span>, and several biologically active and inactive analogues of these polypeptides. The macromolecules were found in the plasma of approximately 2 per cent of ambulatory adults and hospitalized children and 32 per cent of the patients at two institutions for the mentally retarded. The binding properties of these macromolecules were studied by incubating with peptides labeled with 125iodine, and separating bound from free labeled peptide using small gel filtration columns. The peptide-binding macromolecules from several patients were compared. They showed very similar specificity for a group of arginyl peptides of the des-aspartyl1-angiotensin sequence. The plasma binders differed from one another in their optimum pH and their mobility in electrophoretic fields. Those with more acid pH optima displayed more rapid electrophoretic mobility. The binders fell into two classes based on apparent molecular weight, approximately 140,000 and 250,000. Those with the higher apparent molecular weight contained a large proportion of binder that could be precipitated with antiserum to human IgA. Kinetic measurements showed that the plasma binders were somewhat heterogeneous with respect to affinity for (des-asp1)-angiotensin, with apparent association constants ranging from 10(7) to 10(8) M-1. Binding activity was labile to heat, and to treatment with pepsin or trypsin. It was inhibited by calcium, <span class="CHEMICAL">protamine</span>, streptomycin, and some other cationic compounds. The plasma peptide binder differed in specificity and molecular weight from soluble angiotensin-binding molecules extracted from tissues, and from properties expected of a receptor for angiotensin. These macromolecules may be useful reagents for measuring (des-asp1)-angiotensins. Their presence in plasma samples may interfere with angiotensin assays in some circumstances.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='INHIBITOR'><table><tr><td>Evaluation of the role of <span class="CHEMICAL">methional</span>, 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid and peroxidase in ethylene formation by Escherichia coli. During growth of Escherichia coli strain SPA O in the presence of methionine, an intermediate accumulates in the medium. This intermediate reacts with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, and can be degraded to ethylene either enzymically or photochemically, the latter being stimulated by the addition of a flavin. The pH optimum for the photochemical degradation of this intermediate and 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid (KMBA) is pH 3 whereas the optimum for <span class="CHEMICAL">methional</span> is pH 6. The enzyme which converts the intermediate to ethylene also converts KMBA to ethylene and has many of the properties of a peroxidase including inhibition by <span class="GENE">catalase</span>, cyanide, azide and anaerobiosis. The enzyme which synthesizes the intermediate is not known but requires oxygen and pyridoxal phosphate. A pathway for ethylene biosynthesis is proposed in which methionine is converted to KMBA which can be degraded either by peroxidase or in a flavin-mediated photochemical reaction. Its relevance to the properties of other ethylene-producing bacteria and to the proposed pathway of ethylene release by higher plants is discussed.</td></tr></table></div>

The purified enzyme was homogenous on Sephadex G-200 gel filtration, disc electrophoresis and heat inactivation. The purified enzyme was studied and the following results were obtained: 1. The enzyme catalyzed the hydrolysis of a wide variety of phosphomonoesters, but not that of bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate, adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, adenosine 5'-diphosphate or adenosine 5'-triphosphate. 2.

A similar effect was obtained with the inhibitor of <span class="GENE">gaba transaminase</span>, aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA). The interaction of benzodiazepines with the neuroleptic-induced HVA increase was similar in the striatum and in the limbic forebrain and was antagonized by the GABA receptor-blocking agent, picrotoxin. Both the benzodiazepines used and <span class="CHEMICAL">AOAA</span> potentiated the cataleptic effect of the four neuroleptics. It is concluded that benzodiazepines, by intensifying GABA-ergic transmission, enhance the ongoing inhibition of mesencephalic dopamine neurons exerted by the striatonigral GABA system. As a consequence, the feedback activation of dopamine neurons induced by the neuroleptic blockade of dopamine receptors in the striatum and the limbic system is attenuated. This results in a reduction of the neuroleptic-induced increase of HVA and in the potentiation of the cataleptic effect of neuroleptics.</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='INHIBITOR'><table><tr><td>Classification and biological distribution of histamine receptor sub-types. The distribution and classification of histamine receptors in mammalian and avian tissues have been summarized in Tables 1-4. It is evident that histamine receptors are present on a number of morphologically distinct cell types and the proportion of cells bearing H1- and H2-receptors varies not only with the species but also with the cell source. The pharmacological receptors mediating mepyramine-sensitive histamine responses have been defined as H1-receptors. Receptors mediating mepyramine-resistant, but <span class="CHEMICAL">burimamide</span> or metiamide-sensitive histamine responses have been classified as H2-receptors. Histamine responses mediated via H2-receptors seem to involve the adenylcyclase system resulting in elevation of intracellular cyclic-AMP level, which is susceptible to <span class="CHEMICAL">burimamide</span> blockade but insensitive to beta-adrenergic blocking agents. This mode of action of histamine involving H2-receptors and the <span class="GENE">adenyl cyclase</span> system has been shown to stimulate the mammalian heart; promote gastric acid secretion; inhibit antigen-induced histamine release from leucocytes and inhibit lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. It can further be concluded that both H1- and H2-receptors are widely distributed throughout the animal body in the gastro-intestinal, reproductive, respiratory and cardiovascular systems, nervous system and on mast cells and blood leucocytes. In these tissues, histamine receptors play an important role in physiological, immunological and immunopathological processes. Interaction of histamine with both H1- and H2-receptors in varying proportions modulates the overall manifestation of cardiovascular and respiratory syndromes during certain immunopathological conditions (e.g. inflammation, allergy and anaphylaxis). Histamine receptors also appear to play and important role in the development of immuno-competence and immunity.</td></tr></table></div>

Individual casein components were dephosphorylated more rapidly than mixtures of alphas- and beta-caseins or of alphas-, beta-and kappa-caseins and micellar casein.

<div class='INHIBITOR'><table><tr><td>Multiple intracellular peptidases in Neurospora crassa. Neurospora crassa possesses multiple intracellular peptidases which display overlapping substrate specificities. They were readily detected by an in situ staining procedure for peptidases separated in polyacrylamide gels, within which the auxilliary enzyme, l-amino acid oxidase, was immobilized. Eleven different intracellular peptidases were identified by electrophoretic separation and verified by their individual patterns of substrate specificities. Most peptide substrates tested were hydrolyzed by several different peptidases. The multiple intracellular peptidases may play overlapping roles in several basic cell processes which involve peptidase activity. The amount of peptidase activity for leucylglycine present in crude extracts of cells grown under widely different conditions was relatively constant, suggesting that this enzyme may be constitutive, although alterations in the amounts of individual peptidase isozymes may occur. A single enzyme, designated peptidase II, was partially purified and obtained free from the other peptidase species. Peptidase II was found to be an <span class="GENE">aminopeptidase</span> with activity toward many peptides of varied composition and size. It was more active with tripeptides than homologous dipeptides and showed strong activity toward methionine-containing peptides. This enzyme, with a molecular weight of about 37,000, was thermolabile at 65 degrees C and was strongly inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, Zn(2+), Co(2+), and Mn(2+), but was insensitive to the serine protease inhibitor <span class="CHEMICAL">phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride</span>.

This rise was demonstrable over a wide range of substrate concentrations. Both normal and leukemic lymphocytes contained a heat-stable, calcium-dependent activator of <span class="GENE">phosphodiesterase</span>. However, the increased activity of <span class="GENE">phosphodiesterase</span> in leukemic lymphocytes was not due to this protein activator since (a) <span class="GENE">phosphodiesterase</span> activity from these cells was not stimulated by this activator and (b) <span class="GENE">phosphodiesterase</span> activity of leukemic lymphocytes was not inhibited by the calcium chelater, ethylene-glycol-bis,(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid, suggesting that the enzyme was not already maximally activated.

However, the subcellular distribution of the phosphodiesterases was different, and the <span class="GENE">phosphodiesterase</span> of leukemic lymphocytes was significantly more resistant to heat than that of normal lymphocytes. Although no differences were found between the phosphodiesterases of normal and leukemic lymphocytes in their sensitivities to drugs, there were marked differences in drug sensitivity between the <span class="GENE">phosphodiesterase</span> of lymphocytes and that of other tissue. For example, concentrations of <span class="CHEMICAL">chlorpromazine</span> which inhibited <span class="GENE">phosphodiesterase</span> of cerebrum by 70% had no effect on <span class="GENE">phosphodiesterase</span> activity of lymphocytes.

Pyruvate kinase deficiency was studied biochemically in ten homozygous and seven heterozygous individuals who previously had been examined clinically and hematologically (see part I). In crude hemolysates some properties of the deficient enzymes were found to be altered. The pH optimum was shifted towards the alkaline range, and the thermal optimum was found between 17 and 27 degrees Cinstead of between 37 und 47 degrees C. The abnormal enzymes were much less stable than normal pyruvate Kinase (PK), and more susceptible to inhibition by <span class="CHEMICAL">adenosinetriphosphate</span>. The affinity to adenosinediphosphate was normal in all cases whereas the affinity to phosphoenolpyruvate was either normal (two cases/, increased (two cases) or slightly decreased (six cases). Fructosediphosphate activated the abnormal enzymes by a factor of 1.5--18 and simultaneously transformed the sigmoidal affinity curve with phosphoenolpyruvate into the hyperbolic curve known for the normal enzyme. The consumption of glucose and the formation of lactate were higher in PK deficient erythrocytes than in normal <span class="GENE">cells</span> but lower than in erythrocyte populations with similar reticulocyte counts. The formation of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate was markedly increased, whereas its breakdown was low. A close relation between the degree of reticulocytosis and the impairment of glucose metabolism was found. In patients with high reticulocyte counts, i.e. in the splenectomized patients, the highest concentrations of glucose-6-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, 3-phosphoglycerate and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate as well as a high formation and a low breakdown of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and a deficit in lactate formation were found. In heterozygotes, small increases of the concentration of glucose-6-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate and 3-phosphoglycerate were demonstrated. Our results support the conclusion that PK deficiency is mainly a disorder of the reticulocytes. Their metabolism grossly deteriorates within the venous sinuses of the spleen. Splenectomy improves the clinical course because this critical area of microcirculation with a highly unfavourable metabolic milieu is eliminated.</td></tr></table></div>

The Kestrone and KUDP-glucuronic acid are 6.6 muM and 254 muM, respectively. The estrone glucuronyltransferase (UDP-glucuronate: 17 beta-oestradiol 3-glucuronosyltransferase, <span class="GENE">EC 2.4.1.59</span>) exhibits high substrate specificity in that it is inhibited noncompetetively by estradiol-17 beta, estradiol-17 alpha, estriol, testosterone, <span class="CHEMICAL">phenolphthalein</span> and bilirubin; p-nitrophenol and o-aminophenol do not inhibit the glucuronidation of estrone.

J. 155, 81-85]. E.p.r. measurements at 35GHz near to 4.2K showed that the interaction has the same sign at all molybdenum orientations and is ferromagnetic. The predicted splitting of the e.p.r. signal from the reduced iron-sulphur centre, Fe/S I, was observed, Providing positive identification of this as the other interacting species. Chemical modification of the molybdenum environment in xanthine oxidase can change the size of the interaction severalfold, but interaction always remains approximately isotropic. The interaction in turkey liver xanthine dehydrogenase is indistinguishable from that in the oxidase. However, a bacterial xanthine dehydrogenase with different iron-sulphur centres shows rather larger interaction. Guanidinium chloride disturbs the iron-sulphur centres of the oxidase, and when this occurs there is a parallel and relatively small change in the interaction. Removal of <span class="CHEMICAL">flavin</span> from the molecule, or raising the pH to 12.0, changes the interaction slightly without affecting the chromophores themselves.

Iodoacetamide, other alpha-halocarbonyl compounds, and sulfhydryl reagents gave similar selective inactivation of glutamine-dependent activity. Saturation kinetics were not obtained for inactivation by iodoacetamide but protection by glutamine exhibited competitive kinetics. The stoichiometry for alkylation by chloroketone and iodoacetamide was approximately 1 residue per protomer of molecular weight approximately 188,000. The single residue alkylated with iodo [1-14C]acetamide was identified as cysteine by isolation of S-carboxymethylcysteine. This active site cysteine is in the large subunit of molecular weight approximately 153,000. The active site cysteine was sensitive to oxidation by <span class="CHEMICAL">H2O2</span> generated by autooxidation of reduced flavin and resulted in selective inactivation of glutamine-dependent <span class="GENE">enzyme</span> activity.

<div class='INHIBITOR'><table><tr><td>Identification of alpha-adrenergic receptors in human platelets by [3H]dihydroergocryptine binding. Binding of [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine to platelet lysates appears to have all the characteristics of binding to alpha-adrenergic receptors. At 25 degrees C binding reaches equilibrium within 20 min and is reversible upon addition of excess phentolamine. Binding is saturable with 183+/-22 fmol of [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine bound per mg of protein at saturation, corresponding to 220+/-26 sites per platelet. Kinetic and equilibrium studies indicate the dissociation constant of [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine for the receptors is 1-3 nM. The specificity of the binding sites is typical of an alpha-adrenergic receptor. Catecholamine agonists compete for occupancy of the [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine binding sites with an order of potency (-)epinephrine&gt; (-)norepinephrine&gt;&gt; (-)isoproterenol. Stereospecificity was demonstrated inasmuch as the (+)isomers of epinephrine and norepinephrine were 10-20-fold less potent than the (-)isomers. The potent alpha-adrenergic antagonists phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine, and yohimbine competed potently for the sites, whereas beta-antagonists such as propranolol and <span class="CHEMICAL">dichlorisoproterenol</span> were quite weak. Dopamine and serotonin competed only at high concentrations (0.1 mM). The [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine binding sites could also be demonstrated in intact platelets where they displayed comparable specificity, stereospecificity, and saturability. Saturation binding studies with the intact platelets indicated 220+/-45 receptors per platelet, in good agreement with the value derived from studies with platelet lysates. Ability of alpha-adrenergic agonists to inhibit <span class="GENE">adenylate cyclase</span> and of alpha-adrenergic antagonists to antagonize this inhibitory effect directly paralleled ability to interact with the [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine binding sites. These data demonstrate the feasibility of directly studying alpha-adrenergic receptor binding sites in human platelets with [(3)H]dihydroergocryptine.</td></tr></table></div>

The inhibition of dihydro-orotase (E 3.5.2.3) and dihydroorotate (DHO) dehydrogenase (dihydro-orotate oxidase, EC 1.3.3.1) by cellular orotate (OA) in Ehrlich ascites cells was studied by measuring the accumulation of the intermediates of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis at various times after the addition of 6-azauridine to the culture medium. The addition of 6-azauridine resulted in the accumulation of orotidine, OA, <span class="CHEMICAL">DHO</span>, and carbamyl aspartate (CAA). The use of the observed ratios of [CCA]/[OA] and [DHO]/[OA] and other known constants allowed us to calculate that the increased cellular OA concentration caused primarily an inhibition of <span class="CHEMICAL">DHO</span> dehydrogenase rather than an inhibition of <span class="GENE">dihydroorotase</span>. A constant ratio of [CAA]/[DHO] was observed which probably indicates that the interconversion of these two intermediates catalyzed by <span class="GENE">dihydroorotase</span> is near equilibrium in these cells as has been observed in vitro (Christopherson, R.I., Matsuura, T., and Jones, M.E.

<div class='INHIBITOR'><table><tr><td>Catecholamine-induced changes in ion transport in short-circuited frog skin and the effect of beta-blockade. 1. A method for measuring bidirectional Cl fluxes has been used to estimate net Cl movements in short-circuited frog skin and to compare these with the short-circuit current (Isc) and Na fluxes. 2. In some experiments bidirectional fluxes of both Na and Cl were measured simultaneously. It was found that the algebraic sum of the net fluxes of these two ions did not differ significantly from the values of Isc, either in untreated or catecholamine-treated skins, except for the half-hour period immediately after catecholamine addition. 3. The net effluxes of Cl produced by noradrenaline (1-6 X 10(-5)M), isoprenaline (8 X 10(-7)M) and adrenaline (6 and 15 X 10(-6)M) were of similar magnitude for each catecholamine. The magnitude of the Cl response measured as a flux ratio was related to a certain extent to the precatecholamine Cl conductance. 4. The net Na influx was increased by isoprenaline and reduced by noradrenaline. 5. Addition of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent <span class="CHEMICAL">oxprenolol</span> (4-5 X 10(-5)M) to skins stimulated by catecholamine resulted in the disappearance of the net Cl movement and fall in skin conductance and Isc. This fall was similar in magnitude to, and correlated with the mean rise in Isc produced by isoprenaline, but of significantly greater magnitude in the case of noradrenaline. 6. The changes in Na influx were strongly associated with the changes in Isc following catecholamine addition. Similarly, the changes in Na efflux and Cl efflux were correlated, suggesting the Na fluxes to be dissociated, influx and efflux changes perhaps taking place at different loci. 7. Acetazolamide (1-2 X 10(-4)M), added either before or during the noradrenaline stimulation, had no effect on the Cl efflux response. 8. The tissue exchange of Cl from the outside bathing medium after 4 hr was greater in catecholamine-stimulated skins than in those in which the response had been blocked by <span class="CHEMICAL">oxprenolol</span>. 9.

The membrane 5'-AMPase has a Km of 7.0 microM. Relative affinities of the other 5'-mononucleotides for the enzyme are 5'-GMP &gt; 5'-TMP &gt; 5'-UMP &gt; 5'-CMP. There are activity optima at pH7 and 10; the latter is Mg(2+)-dependent. The membrane preparations have a small amount of acid phosphatase activity that is distinct from 5'-AMPase activity but no alkaline phosphatase. AOPCP, <span class="CHEMICAL">ADP</span>, and ATP are strongly inhibitory. Mg2+, Ca2+, or Co2+ additions do not affect the pH 7.0 activity; Mn2+ activates slightly, whereas Zn2+, Cu2+, and Ni2+ are inhibitory. EDTA slowly inactivates, but removal of the EDTA without the addition of divalent cations restores activity. The inactivation is also substantially reversed by Co2+ or Mn2+, but reactivability by divalent cations decreases with time in EDTA. ConA strongly inhibits, and alpha-methyl-D-mannoside or glucose (the latter much less efficiently) relieves the inhibition, indicating that the 5'-AMPase is a glycoprotein. Histidine is also inhibitory. Ouabain, phloretin, cytochalasin B, cysteine, phenyl-alanine, MalNEt, and IAA are without effect. 5'-AMPase activity codistributes with pulse-bound [3H]ouabain when either of two cell fractionation procedures are used. The 5'-AMPase activity per cell is constant at different cell densities in exponentially growing <span class="GENE">cells</span>, and activity per unit cell volume remains constant throughout the cell cycle. These properties, together with its absence in other organelles, its stability to storage, its insensitivity to certain experimental manipulations, and its general insensitivity to inhibitors of specific transport systems, make 5'-AMPase a useful quantitative marker in studies on the regulation of HeLa membrane transport systems.

<div class='INHIBITOR'><table><tr><td>Activation of soluble guanylate cyclase from rat lung by incubation or by hydrogen peroxide. A 37,000 X g supernatant fraction prepared from fat lung homogenate demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold increase in guanylate cyclase activity after incubation at 30 degrees for 30 min (preincubation). Treatment of the supernatant fraction with Triton X-100 increased activity to approximately the same extent as preincubation, but would not increase the activity after preincubation. By chromatography on Sepharose 2B, before and after preincubation, it was demonstrated that the increase in activity was only associated with the soluble guanylate cyclase, and not the particulate enzyme. Activation by preincubation required O2. It was completely inhibited by thiols such as 2-mercaptoethanol, and by bovine serum albumin, KCN, and <span class="CHEMICAL">sodium diethyldithiocarbamate</span>. These inhibitors suggested a copper requirement for activation, and this was confirmed by demonstrating that 20 to 60 muM CuCl2 could relieve the inhibition by 0.1 mM <span class="CHEMICAL">sodium diethyldithiocarbamate</span>. 2-Mercaptoethanol inhibition could also be reversed by removal of the thiol on a Sephadex G-25 column, however, this treatment partially activated the enzyme. Addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to a preincubated preparation would not reverse the activation. H2O2 was found to activate guanylate cyclase, either by its generation in the lung supernatant with glucose oxidase and glucose, or by its addition to a preparation in which the catalase was inhibited with KCN. KCN or bovine serum albumin was able to partially inhibit activation by glucose oxidase plus glucose, however, larger amounts of glucose oxidase could overcome that inhibition, indicating a catalytic role for Cu2+ at low H2O2 concentrations. No direct evidence for H2O2 formation during preincubation could be found, however, indirect evidence was obtained by the spectrophotometric detection of choleglobin formation from <span class="GENE">hemoglobin</span> present in the lung supernatant fluid.

The peptide-binding macromolecules from several patients were compared. They showed very similar specificity for a group of arginyl peptides of the des-aspartyl1-angiotensin sequence. The plasma binders differed from one another in their optimum pH and their mobility in electrophoretic fields. Those with more acid pH optima displayed more rapid electrophoretic mobility. The binders fell into two classes based on apparent molecular weight, approximately 140,000 and 250,000. Those with the higher apparent molecular weight contained a large proportion of binder that could be precipitated with antiserum to human IgA. Kinetic measurements showed that the plasma binders were somewhat heterogeneous with respect to affinity for (des-asp1)-angiotensin, with apparent association constants ranging from 10(7) to 10(8) M-1.

After pretreatment with 6-aminonicotinamide the [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio also declined.

Hydrolysis of N10-formyltetrahydrofolate is catalysed by rat liver N10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase at 21% of the rate of CO2 formation based on comparison of apparent Vmax. values. The Km for (-)-N10-folate is a non-competitive inhibitor of this reaction with respect to N10-formyltetrahydrofolate, with a mean Ki of 21.5 micron for the (-)-isomer. NAD+ increases the maximal rate of N10-formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolysis without affecting the Km for this substrate and decreases inhibition by <span class="CHEMICAL">tetrahydrofolate</span>. The activator constant for NAD+ is obtained as 0.35 mM. 5.

A series of structurally related ansamycins have been analyzed, in a new immobilized template assay, to determine the mechanism by which they inhibit a ribonucleic acid-directed deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase from Moloney murine leukemia virus. By this assay, we can better correlate specific structures of these drugs with inhibitory mechanisms. Using an immobilized template, we were also able to observe drug effects on the stability of complexes formed between the polymerase, a template (polyadenylic acid-agarose), and a primer, as well as to monitor the synthesis of DNA in the presence of drug. For each drug, we determined the complex (intermediate in DNA synthesis) which was primarily affected and whether the effect was due to a destabilization process. Although the activity and specificity of the unsubstituted ansamycins (streptovaricins and rifamycin SV) were modulated by conformation of the molecule and electron density of the aromatic ring, the principal mode of inhibition is, apparently, drug binding to a polymerase-template complex; the drug binds in a manner which prevents subsequent formation of a polymerase-template-primer complex. However, some derivatives of rifamycin SV, when substituted at carbon-3 with bulky or hydrophobic side chains, displayed markedly different modes of action.

Both the calcium-accumulating and glycogenolytic enzymes sediment in a single peak at 33% sucrose on a linear continous sucrose density gradient, and the complex remains intact throughout repeated washing. Glycogen particles appear to be associated with the sarcoplasmic reticulum in situ as well as in the isolated microsomal fraction. The sarcoplasmic reticulum-glycogenolytic complex, monitored by a linked enzyme spectrophotometric assay, shows several features: (a) activation of phosphorylase activity to peak rate occurs over a very rapid time course which cannot be duplicated using combinations of purified enzymes; (b) activation is inhibited by protein kinase inhibitor; (c) <span class="GENE">phosphorylase b</span> functions as in the purified form with respect to AMP (Km, 0.3 mM); (d) in the presence of limiting amounts of glycogen, optimal <span class="GENE">phosphorylase b</span> activity in the sarcoplasmic reticulum requires the presence of debrancher, and the activity is sensitive to inhibitors of that enzyme such as Tris, which suggests the possiblity that the enzymes bear a specific structual relationship to the glycogen present. <span class="GENE">phosphorylase b</span> leads to a activation in the sarcoplasmic reticulum was completely resistant to ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl either)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA).

<div class='INHIBITOR'><table><tr><td>Role of the pneumococcal autolysin (<span class="GENE">murein hydrolase</span>) in the release of progeny bacteriophage and in the bacteriophage-induced lysis of the host cells. The pneumococcal bacteriophage Dp-1 seems to require the activity of the N-acetylmuramic acid-L-alanine amidase of the host bacterium for the liberation of phage progeny into the medium. This conclusion is based on a series of observations indicating that the exit of progeny phage particles is prevented by conditions that specifically inhibit the activity of the pneumococcal autolysin. These inhibitory conditions are as follows: (i) growth of the bacteria on ethanolamine-containing medium; (ii) growth of the cells at pH values that inhibit penicillin-induced lysis of pneumococcal cultures and lysis in the stationary phase of growth; (iii) addition of trypsin or the autolysin-inhibitory pneumococcal Forssman antigen (lipoteichoric acid) to the growth medium before lysis; (iv) infection of an autolysin-defective pneumococcal mutant at a multiplicity of infection less than 10 (treatment of such infected mutant bacteria with wild-type autolysin from without can liberate the entrapped progeny phage particles); (v) release of phage particles and culture lysis can also be inhibited by the addition of <span class="CHEMICAL">chloramphenicol</span> to infected cultures just before the time at which lysis would normally occur. Bacteria infected with Dp-1 under conditions nonpermissive for culture lysis and phage release secrete into the growth medium a substantial portion of their cellular Forssman antigen in the form of a macromolecular complex that has autolysin-inhibitory activity. We suggest that a phage product may trigger the bacterial autolysin by a mechanism similar to that operating during treatment of pneumococci with penicillin (Tomasz and Waks, 1975).</td></tr></table></div>

Electron transport from water to silicomolybdate (+ DCMU) is not coupled to ATP formation, nor is there a measurable accumulation of protons within the membrane (measured by amine uptake).  Silicomolybdate is not inhibitory to phosphorylation per se since neither cyclic nor post-illumination (XE) phosphorylation were inhibited.  4. Uncouplers stimulated electron transport from water to silicomolybdate in the pH range of 6 to 7, but inhibited at pH values near 8.

Experiments reported elsewhere (Fiaquinta, R.T., Dilley, R.A. and Horton, P.(19741 J.

Specificities of the enzyme system towards different cholesteryl esters were examined. No differences in the rate of hydrolysis were observed between cholesteryl oleate, palmitate and linoleate. The data suggest that a single acid lipase, presumably of lysosomal origin, has broad specificity towards triglycerides and cholesteryl esters, and may play a role in the hydrolysis of these lipids during intralysosomal degradation of lipoproteins.</td></tr></table></div>

A <span class="GENE">neutral protease</span> with kininogenase activity was isolated from human polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes by cation exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The protease appears heterogeneous by cation exchange chromatography, isoelectric focusing and cationic disc gel electrophoresis, but homogeneous by gel filtration, sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, SDS-disc gel electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis. By carrying out the electrophoresis of the protease in acrylamide gels of varying concentrations, it was shown that they represent charge isomers. The protease was stable at pH 4-10, but labile to heat, being almost completely inactivated when incubated for 30 min at 70 degrees C. It exhibited proteolytic activity between pH 5 and 9, being maximal at 7.5-8.5. The molecular weight of the PMN protease was estimated to be about 20,000 daltons by gel filtration in aqueous buffer and about 26,000-28,000 daltons by SDS-disc gel electrophoresis and gel filtration in Sepharose 6B in the presence of the dissociating agent guanidine HCl. Its sedimentation coefficient was about 2.7S. Corresponding to the charge heterogeneity, by isoelectric focusing, the kinin-generating and esterolytic activities of the PMN granule lysate focused between pH 6.0 and 11.5, whereas the isolated PMN protease focused between 10.0 and 11.8. With respect to kinin generation, caseinolysis, and alanine esterase activity, the protease was inhibited by <span class="CHEMICAL">DFP</span> and certain chloromethyl ketone inhibitors, as well as the plasma protease inhibitory a1-antitrypsin, a2-macroglobulin and antithrombin III. Both bradykinin and a methionyl-lysyl-bradykinin-like peptide were generated from highly purified kininogens by a lysosomal lysate containing the PMN protease. However, this assay was done with a crude enzyme preparation which contains an aminopeptidase capable of converting lysyl-bradykinin or methionyl-lysyl-bradykinin to bradykinin. When injected intradermally, the protease induced hyperemia, hemorrhage, and moderate enhancement of vascular permeability, but the mixture of the protease and kininogen induced a marked enhancement of vascular permeability.</td></tr></table></div>

High concentrations of EDTA and hydroxyquinoline were inhibitory. Glucan synthetase was fully active in cell-free extracts. Small concentrations of trypsin or subtilopeptidase A from Bacillus subtilis, caused only a slight increase in glucosyl transferase activity, but larger concentrations destroyed beta-glucan synthetase. Acid proteases were neither stimulatory nor destructive. Thus it seems unlikely that beta-glucan synthetase exists in a zymogen form. Glucan synthetase was unstable. It was inactivated more rapidly at 28 C than at 0 C. The presence of substrate, beta-glucan or the protease inhibitors <span class="CHEMICAL">PMSF</span>, Antipain or Pepstatin A did not protect beta-glucan synthetase from inactivation. Glucan synthetase was not stimulated by addition of cellobiose or beta-glucans. The synthesis of beta-glucans was competitively inhibited by UDP (Ki = 0.45 mM).

<div class='INHIBITOR'><table><tr><td>Identification and blockade of <span class="GENE">vascular h2 receptors</span>. Experiments were conducted in anesthetized dogs to determine the nature of receptors mediating vascular actions of histamine. In the perfused gracilis muscle histamine caused vasodilatation that was attenuated in part by mepyramine, an H1-receptor blocker. Metiamide, an H2 blocker, given alone had no effect on dilatation. However, the combination of mepyramine and metiamide resulted in a large attenuation of dilatation. Histamine caused constriction of the perfused saphenous vein that was totally blocked by mepyramine suggesting that venoconstriction by histamine involves only H1 receptors. Histamine infusion caused a fall in arterial pressure and a large reduction in peripheral resistance. Mepyramine attenuated the fall in pressure but not the reduction in resistance. Combined H1- and H2-receptor blockade largely eliminated the effects of histamine infusion further documenting the existence of H1 and H2 receptors. The effects of H1 and <span class="CHEMICAL">h2 antihistamines</span> on a variety of physiological vasodilator responses were examined. Evidence was obtained to indicate that H1- and H2-histamine receptors are involved in the active component of baroreceptor-mediated reflex vasodilatation, poststimulation vasodilatation, sympathetic vasodilatation in the guanethidine-treated dog, and vasodilator responses following compound 48/80. No evidence for the participation of either H1- or H2-histamine receptors in reactive hyperemia or the dilatation accompanying exercise was found.

Membrane-containing preparations from methylamine-grown cells catalysed an N-methylglutamate-dependent uptake of O2 or reduction of cytochrome c, which was sensitive to inhibitors of the electron-transport chain. 3. N-Methylglutamate dehydrogenase activity with phenazine methosulphate or 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol as electron acceptor could be solubilized with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The solubilized enzyme was much less active with cytochrome c as electron acceptor and did not sediment in 1 h at 150000g. Solubilization was accompanied by a change in the pH optimum for activity. 4. The solubilized enzyme was partially purified by Sepharose 4B and hydroxyapatite chromatograpy to yield a preparation 22-fold increased in specific activity over the crude extract. 5.

This mortality was not altered by the social environments even when other mice in the cage were not treated with MA. The mortality of mice individually isolated in cages with transparent walls was significantly higher than that of completely isolated mice. Almost all neuroleptics dose-dependently antagonized the MA toxicity in grouped mice, in small doses. The antagonizing activity of clozapine was somewhat weak, and sulpiride potentiated MA toxicity. Phentolamine and propranolol antagonized the MA toxicity at higher doses than neuroleptics. Reserpine and tetrabenazine previously given to mice remarkably antagonized the MA toxicity.

<div class='INHIBITOR'><table><tr><td>Monoamine oxidase inhibition and the induction of ponto-geniculo-occipital wave activity by reserpine in the cat. Reserpine induces ponto-geniculo-occipital wave activity similar to that seen in the cat during the rapid eye movement phase of sleep. This action of reserpine was blocked by the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, pheniprazine, harmaline and <span class="CHEMICAL">clorgyline</span>, but not deprenyl or its demethylated analog. After a single dose (20 mg/kg) of either pheniprazine or harmaline, the time course of antagonism of the effect of reserpine was in good correspondence with inhibition of monoamine oxidase but not with restoration of the serotonin content of several regions of the brain. Harmaline had a reversible effect while that of pheniprazine persisted for weeks. <span class="CHEMICAL">clorgyline</span> in low doses (0.5-1.0 mg/kg), at which it is a specific inhibitor of type A monoamine oxidase, antagonized the action of reserpine for over 2 weeks. Deprenyl and its demethylated analog failed to suppress the reserpine-induced waves even at 10 times the dose of <span class="CHEMICAL">clorgyline</span> when they should have completely inhibited <span class="GENE">type b monoamine oxidase</span>. In contrast to antagonism of reserpine, suppression of rapid eye movement sleep by these monoamine oxidase inhibitors could be temporally dissociated from their inhibition of the enzyme. It is concluded that suppression of the induction of ponto-geniculo-occipital waves by reserpine after administration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitors is a specific effect of these drugs and is related to inhibition of type A monoamine oxidase. Suppression of rapid eye movement sleep is probably a nonspecific effect and not related to inhibition of the enzyme.</td></tr></table></div>

Its specificity for sphingomyelin as substrate is similar to that of sph'ase 5.0, but it differs from sph'ase 5.0 in its pH optimum (7.4 vs 5.0) and in a requirement for Mg2+ for optimal activity. Other properties of <span class="GENE">sph'ase 7.4</span> that distinguish it from sph'ase 5.0 include (a) its lack of appreciable solubilization during dialysis of crude homogenates (b) a more marked concentrations in grey matter than in white matter (9- to 13- fold vs 1.5- to 2-fold for sph'ase 5.0); (c) inhibition by Ca2+ and Cd2+ ions, and by EDTA; (D) stimulation by dithiothreitol, and inhibition by cysteine, N-ethylmaleimide, and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate; (e) lack of inhibition by nucleotides (AMP.ADP, and ATP) and by <span class="CHEMICAL">NAD</span> plus NADH; and (f) relative instability to storage or manipulation between -20degrees C and 40degrees C. These differences indicate the <span class="GENE">sph'ase 7.4</span> is a different enzyme protein from sph'ase 5.0.

The location of T4D phage-induced dihydrofolate reductase (dfr) has been determined in intact and incomplete phage particles. It has been found that phage mutants inducing a temperature-sensitive dfr (dfrts) procude heat-labile phage particles. The structural dfr produced by these ts mutants was shown to assume different configurations depending on the temperature at which the phage is assembled. Morphogenesis of incomplete phage particles lacking the gene 11 protein on their baseplates was found to be inhibited by reagents binding to dfr, such as antibodies to dfr. Further, cofactor molecules for dfr, such as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, also inhibited the step in morphogenesis involving the addition of gene 11 product. On the other hand, inhibitors of dfr, such as <span class="CHEMICAL">adenosine dephosphoribose</span>, stimulated the addition of the gene 11 protein. It has been concluded that the phage-induced dfr is a baseplate component which is partially covered by the gene 11 protein.

Two weeks after intranigral injections of <span class="CHEMICAL">kainic acid</span>, dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), choline acetyltransferase (CAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were measured in the SN. Histological examination of the SN, and a reduction of striatal <span class="GENE">tyrosine hydroxylase</span> (TH) activity by 94%, confirmed the extensive loss of neuronal cell bodies in the SN. Dopamine stimulation of adenylate cyclase was not reduced in the lesioned SN, supporting the view that dendritically-released dopamine can regulate cyclic AMP synthesis in afferent terminals to these dendrites. Nigral GAD activity was significantly reduced by the lesions, suggesting that there are GAD-containing perikarya in the SN. CAT activity was not affected by the kainic injections, indicating the absence of cholinergic perikarya in the SN. Nigral AChE activity was significantly decreased after kainic injections, thus confirming the presence of AChE within the nigral perikarya. The results suggest that dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase and CAT are located within afferents to the SN, while GAD and AChE are found, to some extent at least, in neuronal soma of the SN.

The matrix fraction contained over 74% of the glutamine synthetase activity and the major proportion of the matirx marker enzymes, <span class="GENE">malate dehydrogenase</span> (71%), NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (83%), and glutamate dehydrogenase (57%).

Bromofuroate, an inhibitor of glutamate dehydrogenase, blocked oxidation of glutamate and of glutamine whereas <span class="CHEMICAL">aminoxyacetate</span>, a transaminase inhibitor, had little or no effect with either substrate. These results indicate that glutamine metabolism is probably initiated by the conversion of glutamine to glutamate rather than to an alpha-keto acid. The localization of a glutaminase activity within avian liver mitochondria plus the absence of an active mitochondrial glutamine transaminase is consistent with the differential effects of the transaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase inhibitors.

Intravenous infusions of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) at doses of 20, 40 or 80 micrograms/kg min-1 for 30 min produced dose-related decrements in blood pressure in conscious rats fitted with indwelling aortic and vena caval catheters. Immediately upon termination of SNP infusions, blood pressure rebounded to levels which were significantly above pre-SNP control values. The following evidence indicates that the rebound increase in blood pressure was due to increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system: (1) plasma renin activity was increased approximately four-fold by SNP, (2) rebound did not occur in nephrectomized rats, (3) rebound was markedly attenuated in animals treated with an <span class="GENE">angiotensin converting enzyme</span> inhibitor, SQ14225, (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline) and (4) beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with <span class="CHEMICAL">propranolol</span> reduced the rebound response. In addition, the magnitude of the rebound following SNP infusions was directly related to the dose of SNP infused.

<div class='INHIBITOR'><table><tr><td>Inhibition of pancreatic islet <span class="GENE">monoamine oxidase</span> by adrenergic antagonists and ethanol. Although the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion of intact animals, it either does not alter, or it inhibits in vitro insulin secretion. This may be because in the higher concentration used in in vitro studies, phentolamine exerts a second pharmacological effect that counterbalances its primary effect of blocking monoamine action. We recently demonstrated that pancreatic islets contain substantial amounts of <span class="GENE">monoamine oxidase</span> (MAO), and that MAO inhibitors such as iproniazid and <span class="CHEMICAL">tranylcypromine</span> can alter insulin secretion. In the present study, we determined if other drugs that affect insulin secretion, alter the MAO activity of homogenates of rabbit pancreatic islets (collagenase technique) or liver. Phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine and propranolol (10 muM and 100 muM) inhibit islet and hepatic MAO. Haloperidol (10muM) inhibits hepatic but not islet MAO, while haloperidol (10muM) does not inhibit MAO in either tissue. Ethanol (270 to 2.7mM) inhibits islet MAO. Hepatic MAO is inhibited by high (270 to 180mM) but not by low (27 to 2.7mM) concentrations of ethanol. Collagenase digestion does not increase the sensitivity of islet and liver MAO to inhibition by phentolamine or ethanol. In the absence of added monoamines, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine do not alter basal or glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from rabbit pancreas. Preincubation of rabbit pancreas with the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) increases the beta cell serotonin content and inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Alpha adrenergic antagonists not only fail to block, but actually potentiate the serotonin inhibition of insulin secretion. We conclude that inhibition of islet MAO may cause an increase in islet monoamine content and these monoamines may alter in vitro insulin secretion. One mechanism through which adrenergic antagonists and ethanol modify in vitro insulin secretion may be by inhibiting pancreatic islet MAO.</td></tr></table></div>

Alum hematoxylin stained cartilage weakly and demonstrated sulfation and sulfonation sites. The iron galleins, iron fluorone black and acid iron hematoxylin do not. A pH 4 iron alum hematoxylin gave no staining of these sites; an alum hematoxylin acidified with 1% 12 N HCl gave weaker results. Deamination prevented eosin and orange G counterstains but did not impair nuclear stains with any of the mordant dye lakes.

Brinolase, a fungal protease advocated for thrombolytic therapy, released kinin peptides from semi-purified kininogens of the human, rabbit, guinea pig, and mouse, and moreover cleaved an arginyl bond of the chromogenic peptide S2160. Its kinetics demonstrated marked differences from the mammalian protease <span class="GENE">trypsin</span>. Whereas <span class="GENE">trypsin</span> liberated 100% of the available kinin in 30 min at pH 8, brinolase generated a maximum of only 22% under optimal conditions, viz. incubation of 5 microgram/ml enzyme at pH 4.7 for 5 min. Longer incubations yielded less detectable kinin. This maximal release at acidic pH was not due to increased kininogen consumption, nor was it inhibited by the acid protease inhibitor <span class="CHEMICAL">pepstatin</span>.

The alpha blocking agent, phentolamine, had no effect on mitosis. When added in conjunction with epinephrine or norepinephrine, no reduction of the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition was observed. The beta blocking agent, propranolol, by itself showed slight mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-6) M. When added along with epinephrine or noreinephrine, propranolol reduced the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition approximately 65%. In addition, propranolol blocked mitotic inhibition caused by phenylephrine, an alpha adrenergic agent. However, another beta blocking agent, dichloroisoproterenol, showed strong mitotic inhibition (53%) when added to the cultures at a concentration of 1 X 10(-8) M. The effect was reduced to zero in the presence of propranolol. These data suggest that while beta receptors may be involved in the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition of human keratinocytes in vitro, the nature of the receptor-molecule interaction may be complex.</td></tr></table></div>

This network was resistant to <span class="GENE">collagenase</span> and glycosidase digestion but was removed after papain digestion, suggesting that it was a protein or glycoprotein that did not contain glycosaminoglycans. These methods have allowed visualization of lung proteoglycans and have identified a structure that does not contain glycosaminoglycan that is intimately associated with collagen.

The enzyme from the wild-type was 10 times more sensitive to inhibition by <span class="CHEMICAL">amethopterin</span> and more susceptible to heat denaturation. The apparent Km values for dihydrofolate in enzymes from the three strains were in the range of 4.8--7.2 muM and for NADPH 6.5--8.0 muM. The amethopterin-resistant strain exhibited cross-resistance to trimethoprim and was about 40-fold more resistant to the latter than the sensitive parent and the wild-type.  The resistance to trimethoprim appears to be a direct result of the increased dihydrofolate reductase activity.

Preincubation of interstitial cells with indomethacin (10(-5) or 10(-6) M) for 30 minutes did not alter subsequent basal or LH (100ng)-induced testosterone production. Accumulation of cAMP was stimulated by LH (10 microgram) or by PGs (1.3 X 10(-4) M PGA1, <span class="CHEMICAL">PGA2</span>, PGB1, PGE1 or PGF2alpha). The PG-induced cAMP accumulation thus occurred at concentrations where LH-stimulated testosterone production was inhibited.

These results indicate that PGs can block testosterone production by a direct effect on testicular interstitial cells and suggest that PGs exert their inhibitory action distal to stimulation of cAMP formation.

Bilateral destruction of the NTS caused a fulminating hypertension and tachycardia similar to that after cutting the baroreceptor afferent fibres.

Irreversible inhibition by indomethacin and by the substrate analogue 5,8,11,14-tetraynoic acid was also unaffected by salicylic acid or by 1,10-phenanthroline, which thus probably exert a specific interaction with the aspirin-binding site. Inactivation of platelet cyclo-oxygenase with arachidonic acid led to inhibition of the formation of thromboxane A2 and of aggregation due to arachidonic acid itself and to <span class="GENE">collagen</span>, but barely affected aggregation by thrombin, even though generation of thromboxane A2 was blocked.

<div class='INHIBITOR'><table><tr><td>Purification and characterization of extracellular soluble and membrane-bound insoluble alkaline phosphatases possessing phosphodiesterase activities in Bacillus subtilis. A membrane-bound insoluble alkaline phosphatase (APase) and an extracellular soluble APase were purified, respectively, from a membrane preparation of Bacillus subtilis 6160-BC6, which carries a mutation to produce APase constitutively, and from a culture fluid of a mutant strain. RAN 1, isolated from strain 6160-BC6, which produces an extracellular soluble APase. The two preparations were homogeneous, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate discontinuous gel electrophoresis and by gel electrophoreses in the presence of 8 M urea at pH 9.3 and 4.3. RAN 1 APase was crystallized. Both preparations possessed phosphatase and phosphodiesterase activities, and their pH optima were both at 9.5. They were competitively inhibited by phosphate or <span class="CHEMICAL">arsenate</span> and were activated by the addition of Ca2+ but not by Zn2+. The APase and <span class="GENE">alkaline phosphodiesterase</span> activities seemed to be contained in the same protein molecule. The molecular weight of 6160-BC6 APase was estimated to be 46,000 +/- 1,000, and that of RAN 1 APase was estimated to be 45,000 +/- 1,000. The largest difference between the 6160-BC6 and RAN 1 APase's was in solubility in low-ionic-strength solutions. Present results suggest that each enzyme is composed of a single polypeptide chain and that 6160-BC6 APase aggregates in solutions of low ionic strength.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='INHIBITOR'><table><tr><td>Effect of pharmacological agents on human keratinocyte mitosis in vitro. <span class="GENE">II</span>. Inhibition by catecholamines. Catecholamines produce mitotic inhibition in primary cell cultures of human keratinocytes probably via a block in the G2 part of the cell cycle. Epinephrine produced significant mitotic inhibition (49%) at a concentration as low as 4.5 X 10(-10) M, while its analog, isoproterenol, produced 47% inhibition at 1 X 10(-10) M. Norepinephrine elicited a 49% inhibitory response at 1 X 10(-8) M. One other catecholamine, dopamine, caused a 53% decrease in mitosis at 1 X 10(-6) M. Other structurally related amines to exhibit mitotic inhibition were <span class="CHEMICAL">phenylephrine</span>, 58% at 1 X 10(-7) M; octopamine, 47% at 1 X 10(-5) M; and tyramine, 52% at 1 X 10(-4) M. Serotonin showed no mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-4) M. Various alpha and beta adrenergic blocking agents were added to the cell system. The alpha blocking agent, phentolamine, had no effect on mitosis. When added in conjunction with epinephrine or norepinephrine, no reduction of the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition was observed. The beta blocking agent, propranolol, by itself showed slight mitotic inhibition at 1 X 10(-6) M. When added along with epinephrine or noreinephrine, propranolol reduced the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition approximately 65%. In addition, propranolol blocked mitotic inhibition caused by <span class="CHEMICAL">phenylephrine</span>, an alpha adrenergic agent. However, another beta blocking agent, dichloroisoproterenol, showed strong mitotic inhibition (53%) when added to the cultures at a concentration of 1 X 10(-8) M. The effect was reduced to zero in the presence of propranolol. These data suggest that while beta receptors may be involved in the catecholamine-induced mitotic inhibition of human keratinocytes in vitro, the nature of the receptor-molecule interaction may be complex.</td></tr></table></div>

The ability of antimuscarinics, tricyclic antidepressants, and antipsychotics to block the <span class="GENE">muscarinic acetylcholine receptor</span> was determined using an assay for this receptor in cultured nerve cells. The technique involved the assay of receptor-mediated formation of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate (cyclic GMP) from radioactively labeled guanosine 5'-triphosphate in living mouse neuroblastoma cells (clone N1E-115). This cyclic GMP formation occurred rapidly (peak at 30 sec) and was dependent on the concentration of agonist. The psychotropic drugs tested blocked the muscarinic receptor and equilibrium dissociation constants (KB) were calculated from the parallel displacement of dose-response curves. The most potent compound was the antimuscarinic dexetimide (KB= 5 X 10(-11) M); while the least potent was the antipsychotic prochlorperzine (KB=4X10(-5) M). All tricyclic antidepressants with tertiary amine side chains were more potent (2-20 times) than those with secondary amine side chains; whereas phenothiazine potency correlated with the side chain structure as follows: piperadine greater than <span class="CHEMICAL">alkylamine</span> greater than or equal to piperazine.

Guanylate cyclase in cultured neuroblastoma N1E 115 cells was readily solubilized. MgCl2 as well as MnCl2 served as a metal cofactor of the guanylate cyclase. The maximal guanylate cyclase activity obtained with MgC12 was 80% of that with MnCl2. When the supernatant of cell homogenate was adjusted to pH 5.2, all of enzyme activity was precipitated. The guanylate cyclase activity recovered in the pH 5.2 precipitate was reduced to about 10% of the original supernatant.

The metal content of carboxypeptidase Y was analyzed by the atomic absorption method. After exhaustive dialysis against an EDTA solution, the enzyme showed no loss of activity nor any significant content of metals (Zh,Mg,Ca,Cu,Mn,Ni,Fe, and Co). The activity was, however, rather sensitive to preincubation with various metals. The reactivity of a serine residue of the enzyme was also reevaluated. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) stoichiometrically and irreversively inhibited the enzyme. The rate of inactivation with <span class="CHEMICAL">DFP</span> was much faster than that for typsin [<span class="GENE">EC 3.4.21.4</span>] and chymotrypsin [EC 3.4.21.1.], while the rate with PMSF was one-fifteenth of that for chymotrypsin.

Dibenamine (DB) produced contraction due to influx and release of Ca in normal medium, whereas it produced relaxation of the K-induced contraction due to depression of the activity of the muscle cell membrane. DB inhibited active influx, passive influx and release of Ca induced by ACh in this order as the concentrations were increased and also inhibited the contraction by <span class="CHEMICAL">histamine</span> selectively as compared with the contractions by ACh, K and Ba, the inhibition of the ACh-, K- and Ba-contractions being almost to the same degree. In addition, DB inhibited to much the same degree the phasic contraction(PC) and tonic contraction(TC) by <span class="CHEMICAL">histamine</span>, whereas it inhibited TC in preference to PC induced by ACh, K and Ba. Irreversible inhibition by DB of ACh-, K- and Ba-induced contractions were protected by Ca, whereas those of histamine-induced contraction were selectively protected by <span class="CHEMICAL">histamine</span> and antihistamine, but not by Ca. These results indicate that the antagonism of DB and its irreversibility against <span class="CHEMICAL">histamine</span> may be due to blockade of the <span class="GENE">histaminergic receptor</span>, whereas those against ACh, K and Ba may be due to inhibition of the Ca-site.

After <span class="GENE">glucagon</span> injection, rats showed virtually identical percentage increases in hepatic histidine-pyruvate aminotransferase and serine-pyruvate aminotransferase activities, both in the mitochondria and in the cytosol. Histidine-pyruvate aminotransferase isoenzyme 1, with pI8.0, was purified to homogeneity from the mitochondrial fraction of liver from glucagon-injected rats. The purified enzyme catalysed transamination between a number of amino acids and pyruvate or phenylpyruvate. For transamination with pyruvate, the activity with serine reached a constant ratio to that with histidine during purification, which was unchanged by a variety of treatments of the purified enzyme. Serine was found to act as a competitive inhibitor of histidine transamination, and histidine of serine transamination. These results suggest that histidine-pyruvate amino-transferase isoenzymes 1 is identical with serine-pyruvate aminotransferase. The enzyme is probably composed of two identical subunits with mol. wt. approx. 38000.

Neither D-glyceraldehyde nor pyridine 3-aldehyde, both substrates for this broadly specific enzyme, protected the enzyme from inactivation but 1 mM NADPH or NADP completely prevented the loss of activity by 2,3-butanedione suggesting the involvement of arginine in the binding of cofactor.

Cationized ferritin (CF) of narrow pI range (7.3-7.5) and the basic dye ruthenium red (RR) have been used as cationic probes to partially characterize anionic sites previously demonstrated in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). When <span class="DISEASE">CF</span> was given i.v. to normal rats and the left kidney was fixed by perfusion 15 min thereafter, clusters of <span class="DISEASE">CF</span> molecules were found throughout the lamina rara interna (LRI), lamina rara externa (LRE), and mesangial matrix distributed at regular (approximately 60 nm) intervals. When kidneys were perfused with <span class="CHEMICAL">aldehyde</span> fixative containing RR, small (20 nm) RR-stained particles were seen in the same locations distributed with the same 60 nm repeating pattern, forming a quasiregular, lattice-like arrangement. Fine (approximately 3 nm) filaments connected the sites and extended between them and the membranes of adjoining endothelial and epithelial cells. When <span class="DISEASE">CF</span> was given i.v. followed by perfusion with RR in situ, both probes localized to the same sites. <span class="DISEASE">CF</span> remained firmly bound after prolonged perfusion with 0.1-0.2 M KCl or NaCl.

These experiments demonstrate the existence of a quasi-regular, lattice-like network of anionic sites in the LRI and LRE and the mesangial matrix. The sites are demonstrable in vivo (by <span class="DISEASE">CF</span> binding), in fixed kidneys (by RR staining), and in isolated GBM's (by <span class="DISEASE">CF</span> binding). The results obtained with <span class="DISEASE">CF</span> show that the binding of <span class="DISEASE">CF</span> (and probably also RR) to the laminae rarae is electrostatic in nature since it is displaced by treatment with buffers of high ionic strength or pH.

Electrocorticographic (ECoG) and depth recordings have previously demonstrated the epileptogenic nature of surgical concentrations of the volatile anesthetic <span class="CHEMICAL">enflurane</span>. We contrasted ECoG activity with local cerebral glucose uptake [( 14C]2-deoxyglucose autoradiography) in 23 brain structures in order to identify the epileptogenic foci. Autoradiograms were obtained from sectioned rat brain following a 30 min period of steady-state anesthesia at 1, 1.5, or 2 MAC (minimum alveolar concentration) <span class="CHEMICAL">enflurane</span>. Pseudo-epileptiform ECoGs were obtained at 1 MAC where bursts of slow waves and sharp waves were evoked by peripheral sensory stimulation. At 1.5 MAC, the ECoG displayed frank, spontaneous epileptiform activity with large amplitude spike-wave complexes; repetitive auditory stimulation occasionally precipitated grand-mal seizures. At 2 MAC, spike complexes were less frequent and could not be repetitively driven. At 1 MAC <span class="CHEMICAL">enflurane</span>, regional cerebral metabolism was generally depressed approximately 14% from the awake controls. However, metabolism in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and other subcortical structures in the limbic brain was increased. At 1.5 MAC this dichotomy in local cerebral metabolic rate was maximal; we observed increased metabolism in the hippocampus, habenula, habenulo-interpeduncular tract and interpeduncular nucleus and pineal. Metabolism in all other structures was significantly depressed (P less than 0.05) compared to awake values. At 2 MAC, metabolism was decreased in all structures. We conclude that the low <span class="DISEASE">seizure</span> threshold hippocampus and related structures associated with the limbic system and its pathways are the epileptogenic foci for seizures induced with <span class="CHEMICAL">enflurane</span> in the rat.

Fifty healthy mothers, with normal placental function, were anaesthetised with <span class="CHEMICAL">ketamine</span> for Caesarean section. Anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide, oxygen, muscle relaxants and controlled ventilation. Surgery was conducted in the lateral tilt position. Arterial blood samples were drawn from the mothers, and from the vessels of a double clamped section of umbilical cord, for blood-gas analysis. Results obtained were compared with those of a previous series anaesthetised with thiopentone, nitrous oxide, oxygen and muscle relaxants. Eight infants were clinically depressed, judged on the basis of their modified Apgar score 2 minutes after delivery. The average time to sustained respiration (TSR) was 58.1 seconds. The mean maternal pH and base excess values in the <span class="CHEMICAL">ketamine</span> group were significantly greather than those reported after thiopentone anaesthesia. Mean Uv and Ua pH levels were also significantly higher after ketamine; in contrast, the average fetal base excess values did not differ from those obtained previously with thiopentone. The mean (Ma-Uv) and (Ma-Ua), pH gradients were 0.019 and 0.025 pH units greater respectively in the <span class="CHEMICAL">ketamine</span> group compared to the thiopentone (P less than 0.005). The average (Uv-Ua) PO2 gradient was 3.4 mmHg less after <span class="CHEMICAL">ketamine</span> anaesthesia (P less than 0.005). A significant inverse correlation was observed relating the I-D interval to the Ma and Ua pH values. Maternal arterial base deficit values appeared to increase with delay in delivering the fetus. Prolongation of the uterine incision to delivery (U-D) interval was associated with a decrease in Ua pH and base excess values. (Ma-Ua) pH and base excess gradients increased with lengthening of the U-D interval. No convincing evidence of awareness during anaesthesia was found during the study. Five patients, appeared to be hallucinated in the immediate post-anaesthetic period. Unpleasant dreams were reported in 5 instances.

There are a number of possible substrate materials (nucleophilic) in a cells, but the dominant one which has been suspected is the nucleic acid component, either the DNA or the RNA. The bases of these materials all have extra pi electrons susceptible to attach by the electrophiles of the carcinogen. Such a modification, particularly of the DNA, could lead to either major or minor changes in the genetic composition of the cell.

The highest specificity for alcoholism was achieved by gamma-ALAD; the best overall performance, with highest sensitivity and specificity was, however, gamma-GT.

The present paper is concerned with those optical phenomena which may be caused in histological structures by the <span class="CHEMICAL">toluidine</span> blue reaction. They relate to absorption as well as refraction properties. The paper gives a detailed description of how the <span class="CHEMICAL">toluidine</span> blue reaction is carried out on histological preparations. The analysis of absorption results leads, in connection with physicochemical considerations, to a new explanation of the cause of <span class="CHEMICAL">toluidine</span> blue <span class="DISEASE">metachromasia</span>. In this, the assumption is made that the conditions of attachment of protons to the hydrogen-bearing nitrogen of dye molecules are largely responsible for the occurrence of <span class="DISEASE">metachromasia</span>, the way in which the attachment of the proton to this quaternary nitrogen is influenced being of no consequence in this particular connection. It may result from both a combination of homogeneous <span class="CHEMICAL">toluidine</span> blue molecules into associates and a shift to the alkaline region of the pH value of the dye solution. However, the term <span class="DISEASE">metachromasia</span> is used to describe only that shift of the absorption spectrum which is produced by associates. The thus produced <span class="DISEASE">metachromasia</span> ("concentration metachromasia") involves the development of a so-call "gamma-band" (with an absorption peak of gamma = 546 nm), there being a causal rather than a fundamental difference between the latter band and the normal metachromatic mu-band (with an absorption peak of gamma = 540 nm). Whereas in the case of concentration <span class="DISEASE">metachromasia</span> and for an aqueous solution there may be observed an association of dye molecules having a maximum intermolecular distances of less than 5 angstrom units, which is due to the large number of <span class="CHEMICAL">toluidine</span> blue molecules per unit volume, mu-metachromasia is usually observed in connection with chromotropic structures. This association results in the lone-pair electrons of the hydrogen-bearing nitrogen atom being included in the intermolecular resonance system, which in turn results in the attachment of a proton to this nitrogen being weakened, which leads to the assumption of a red color. The difference to gamma-metachromasia lies in the fact that even by treatment with dilute solutions, in which the dye is present in a monomeric form, such a <span class="DISEASE">metachromasia</span> may be produced on account of the sufficiently dense charge pattern of the chromotropic structure. This particular pattern tends to induce an association of dye molecules which in turn are associated, through hydrogen bridges, with the anionic groups. The orthochromatic <span class="CHEMICAL">toluidine</span> blue reaction was found to be a possible method of detecting bridge-bond-active hydrogen in histological structures. The cause of the assumption of a blue color, which is observed in this connection, is a monomeric attachment of the dye.

Following oral administration, 50% of the radioactive dose was recovered in the urine in four days; 8-14% of the dose was excreted as unchanged drug. The fecal specimens accounted for 5-9% of the dose. Following intravenous administration an initial rapid elimination of drug from the plasma was observed [(t1/2)alpha approximately 0.4 hr, (t1/2)beta approximately 4 hr]. The data are consistent with the rapid elimination of radioactivity, approximately 30% of dose, in the urine during the first 24 hr, followed by a much slower rate of excretion of drug and metabolites. These findings are congruous with the high affinity (greater than 98%) of MK-196 and the major metabolite with plasma proteins. The urinary metabolites were isolated and identified by the following techniques: solvent extraction, column, thin-layer, and gas-liquid chromatography, derivatization, and mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The major metabolite, which resulted from para-hydroxylation of the 2-phenyl substitutent, accounted for about 40% of the urinary radioactivity. Reduction of the ketone group, methylation of the p-hydroxy group, and additional phenyl ring hydroxylation were also shown to occur.

<div class='CHEMICAL-INDUCED-DISEASE'><table><tr><td>Serotonin antagonists and central <span class="DISEASE">hyperthermia</span> produced by biogenic amines in conscious rabbits. Previous studies have shown that the <span class="DISEASE">hyperthermia</span> produced by intracerebroventricular injection of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) to conscious rabbits was antagonized by cyproheptadine and increased by LSD. Other putative antagonists, i.e. cinanserin, methiothepin, 2-bromo LSD, methysergide and <span class="CHEMICAL">dimetiotazine</span> are investigated in the present report. Cinanserin and methiothepin resembeld cyproheptadine, 2-bromo LSD had almost the same effects as LSD and methysergide exhibited a mixed pattern of action, being depressant or potentiating as a function of dose. <span class="CHEMICAL">dimetiotazine</span> had no specific action. Cinanserin, however, differed from cyproheptadine in selectively antagonizing and early component of the 5-HT rise, unmasking an important fall and leaving a late hyperthermic component unaffected, thus disclosing three distinct effects of 5-HT action. The cinanserin, methiothepin and methysergide antagonism of the 5-HT-induced temperature rise was greater than the antagonism of the noradrenaline (NA)-induced rise. Methiothepin and methysergide inhibited both the 5-HT and DA hyperthermia; cinanserin--like cyproheptadine--was more effective on the 5-HT rise. The potentiation of the 5-HT temperature rise by 2-bromo LSD and methysergide was more developed than was the potentiation of the NA and DA rises. The effects of the drugs studied on 5-HT action argue in favour of the existence of several types of central 5-HT receptors. The dissociation observed between the antagonism to 5-HT and that to DA does not favour a mediation of DA <span class="DISEASE">hyperthermia</span> by 5-HT; antiserotonin drug antagonism of DA <span class="DISEASE">hyperthermia</span> is more simply accounted for by interactions at the level fo specific DA receptors. The potentiation of the 5-HT-induced temperature rise by 2-bromo LSD and methysergide might result from an antagonism of the hypothermic component.

After a cardiotoxic dose of 20 mg/kg <span class="CHEMICAL">isoprenaline</span>, s.c., blood pressure fell from 117 to 72 mm Hg, heart rate accelerated from 326 to 497 beats/minute, and cardiac work diminished by about 15%. Metabolic rate increased by about 80%, blood values of PO2 rose, and those of PCO2 fell somewhat, whereas blood pH dropped from 7.48 to 7.38, indicating <span class="DISEASE">metabolic acidosis</span>. Propranolol (40 mg/kg, i.p.) and verapamil (50 mg/kg, i.p.), both of which almost completely prevented isoprenaline-induced cardiac necroses, inhibited the chronotropic and calorigenic actions of <span class="CHEMICAL">isoprenaline</span> by about 50%.

Eleven beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents and derivatives were evaluated for their ability to affect systolic arterial blood pressure and pulse rate in unanesthetized, male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) controls. Animals ranged from 7 to 76 weeks of age. The subcutaneous injection of 5 and 45 mg/kg metoprolol in 52 to 64 week old SHRs and 45 mg/kg twice a day to 26 to 29 week old SHRs produced a significant decrease in blooc pressure. The subcutaneous injection of pindolol (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) produced a greater and more consistent depressor effect in mature SHRs. The subcutaneous administration of <span class="CHEMICAL">sotalol</span> (100 mg/kg) and alprenolol (20 mg/kg) resulted in a depressor action which was significant 120 minutes after injection of the drug. In the doses used, propranolol, oxprenolol, 4-hydroxypropranolol and K9-1366 produced pressor effect in SHRs. Propranolol did not cause this pressor effect in prehypertensive (seven week old) SHRs. Practolol, dextro-propranolol and KO-1313 had no effect on blood pressure in the doses used. Propranolol, pindolol, metoprolol, dextro-propranolol, 4-hydroxypropranolol, practolol, oxprenolol, KO-1366 and KO-1313 produced no significant effects on blood pressure in normotensive WKY controls in the doses tested. Placing oral doses of 160 mg/kg/day of metoprolol in the drinking water for seven days significantly lowered blood pressure in 14 week old SHRs previously exposed to ineffective doses of 77 mg/kg/day for 24 days. The administration of oral doses of oxprenolol (40 mg/kg/day) in drinking water for three weeks had a slight but insignificant pressor effect. Smaller doses of metoprolol (15 and 39 mg/kg/day for three to four weeks) and practolol (70 to 85 mg/kg/day for two weeks) had no effect on 52 week old SHRs. Oral doses of pindolol, metoprolol, practolol and oxprenolol had no significant effect on blood pressure in WKY controls. There was no clear relationship between the effects of the drugs on blood pressure and their ability to affect the pulse rate. Similarly, there did not appear to be any consistent relationship between the potency of the beta-blocking drug and the blood pressure lowering action. In addition, neither cardioselective beta-blockade nor sympathomimetic properties allowed the prediction of blood pressure responses to the administration of those agents possessing these features. Although SHRs provide a valuable model of human essential <span class="DISEASE">hypertension</span>, the variable effects reported here and elsewhere in the literature require caution as to the applicability and usefulness of testing and evaluating beta-adrenergic blocking drugs for theri potential anti-hypertensive effects in this particular form of experimental <span class="DISEASE">hypertension</span>.</td></tr></table></div>

Bolus injections of labeled DMO, vascular, extracellular and water indicators were made into the left anterior descending coronary artery, and blood samples were collected from the great cardiac vein. The steady state distribution of DMO between cells and plasma was calculated from the mean transit times of the indicator. Normal myocardial cell pH averaged 6.94 and changed by 58% of the concomitant alterations in plasma pH after infusions of acid or alkali. <span class="DISEASE">myocardial ischemia</span> induced by inflation of a balloon tip catheter in the left anterior descending coronary artery resulted in progressive decreases in cell pH to 6.59 by 1 hour.

Ventriculograms revealed improved wall motion in the ischemic segment after infusion of alkali. Precordial mapping showed a significant reduction in the number of leads with S-T segment elevation as well as in the sum of S-T segment elevations, but R wave amplitudes did not differ from those in control studies. Calculations of extracellular space, tissue water and cation content revealed a reduced gain of cell sodium ion and loss of cell potassium ion during ischemia after alkali treatment.

The non-ulcerogen derivative of cysteamine, ethanolamine, did not increase mortality when given in combination with metiamide. The gastric hyperacidity elicited by cysteamine was reduced by metiamide or vagotomy, the latter being more effective in this respect. Thus, the chemically induced duodenal ulcer in rats resembles the human peptic ulcer disease in sensitivity to therapeutic modalities and may serve as an appropriate model to study the role of neural, hormonal, and other factors in the etiology and pathogenesis of this disorder.</td></tr></table></div>

FC has been prescribed alone, or as a complement to current anticoagulant or digitalis treatment; combination with prenylamine, amiodarone, dysopyramide or a drug of the quinidine group must always be avoided, and the potassium level checked and corrected if necessary before treatment. In 78 cases of atrial fibrillation, the authors found that sinus rhythm was restored in 58 (74.4%); four cases of flutter were restored, and one case out of two of atrial tachycardia. In case of <span class="DISEASE">supraventricular and ventricular extrasystoles</span> the results are less clear, and merit a further study with a larger number of cases. The electrocardiographic disorders encountered in this series have been evaluated: lenghthening of the QT interval, disorders of atrioventricular conduction, sinus inhibition. They were either produced by or aggravated by the FC. No cases of axis deviation were encountered. The authors make mention of the complications observed by other authors, but draw a distinction between the prescription of FC in cases of cerebral vascular insufficiency, without previous knowledge of the exact cardiac status of the patient (otherwise there is a risk of severe accidents), and the use of FC in cases of arrhythmia which have undergone full assessment before the drug is used. According to this study, FC appears to be a very effective anti-arrhythmic agent, but its use demands very rigorous clinical and electrocardiographic supervision.</td></tr></table></div>

The source of the histamine released during damage to the gastric mucosa has been investigated in rats using perfused total gastric pouches. Two groups of rats were treated with either intraperitoneal normal saline or compound 48/80, and agent that produces mast cell degranulation, over a 5-day period. On the 5th day, total gastric pouches were prepared and connected to a perfusion circuit that enabled a 20-ml volume to be circulated through the pouches. The experiments consisted of three 30-min periods during which transmucosal potential difference was monitored and ionic (hydrogen and sodium) flux measured; standard acid solution was used in the first two periods and a taurocholate solution in the third. <span class="CHEMICAL">sodium taurocholate</span> produced a significant increase in ionic flux and fall in the potential difference, the magnitude of the changes being similar in the 48/80- and saline-treated groups. Histamine was released from the mucosa in significantly greater amounts during the taurocholate period, and the increase was similar in both groups of rats. Histological examination of the stomachs confirmed mast cell degranulation in the 48/80-treated groups. We conclude that the histamine released during mucosal damage is probably derived from the "nonmast cell pool" and that this histamine may play a role in mediating the mucosal damage.</td></tr></table></div>

Malignant neoplasms of endocrine tissues represent almost half of the cancers diagnosed clinically in the United States, and many of these respond to hormonal therapies. Estrogen-induced testicular <span class="DISEASE">leydig cell tumor</span>s in the mouse would seem to represent a realistic model for the laboratory investigation of this significant group of cancers. Data accumulated over the past few years clearly show that the Leydig cell is a target tissue for estrogens. Administering large doses of <span class="CHEMICAL">estrogen</span> results in a reduction of enzymes converting progesterone to testosterone and induces a transient, but quantitatively very significant, synthesis of DNA in the Leydig cells of tumor-susceptible strains of mice. Neither of these actions of <span class="CHEMICAL">estrogen</span> is mediated via the hypophysis. It has been demonstrated that the Leydig cells have specific protein receptors in their cytoplasm that bind estrogens and transport them to the nucleus where they are also bound. The genetic composition of the Leydig cells themselves is extremely important for the development of tumors. An adequately functioning pituitary gland is also essential for tumor formation. Confining the testes to the abdomen results in enzyme changes similar to those produced by <span class="CHEMICAL">estrogen</span> administration and significantly augments the development of <span class="DISEASE">leydig cell tumor</span>s.

In the experimental groups, the early lesions, except the coronaries, were almost entirely distal to the orifices, and maintained roughly the same contour while spreading around the orifice. The coronary lesions completely encircled the orifices as described previously. As lesions progressed, they became elevated and often granular, so that the lesions themselves may have affected flow profiles around the orifices.

It is suggested that since PGE1 is produced by the brain normally, and in increased amounts as the result of overstimulation, irritation or trauma, this potent autacoid may play a role in the spontaneous development of latent epileptogenic foci or the recurrence of <span class="DISEASE">epileptic seizure</span>s.</td></tr></table></div>

The lack of any rotational behaviour in unilaterally dopamine lesioned animals after <span class="CHEMICAL">ipecacuana</span> or emetine is a strong indication that these substances lack dopamine receptor stimulating properties when administered systematically. Our results thus support those of Lal et al. (1972). Our results do not allow any conclusions concerning the working mechanism of emetine. However, the lack of central dopamine receptor stimulating properties should probably not be explained by an inability to enter through the blood brain barrier but rather a lack of effect on dopamine receptors. This reasoning  would also exclude the dopamine receptors in the chemo-trigger zone as responsible for the emetic effect.

A Pneumococcal mutant, sulr-c, resistant to sulfonamides, and three transformants bearing associated d or d+ resistance markers have earlier been reported to be unstable and show distinct patterns and frequencies of segregating stable progeny lacking the c marker. Each of the four <span class="DISEASE">strains</span> showed a characteristic dosage of the genes involved in the merodiploidy. Complementary strands of DNA's from these stable and unstable <span class="DISEASE">strains</span> were resolved and homoduplex and heteroduplex hybrids made from the separated DNA strands were used as donors in genetic transformations. Activities of a normal marker (streptomycin resistance) and those involved in the heterozygosity (c, d and d+) were quantitatively measured. From those heteroduplexes made up of opposite strands derived from a heterozygote and a stable strain, the normal marker is transferred efficiently, but the heterozygous markers are not. On the other hand, if both strands of a heteroduplex are derived from different heterozygotic <span class="DISEASE">strains</span>, all markers can be transferred with usual efficiency to a stable recipient strain. The lowered efficiency in the former type of heteroduplex is attributed to an inhomology resulting from a tandem duplication in the merodiploid <span class="DISEASE">strains</span>, and a postulated DNA repair process stimulated by it while in the form of the donor duplex. The inhomology probably includes (a) a microheterogeneity between the c site and the wild type locus, and (b) a more extensive incompatibility attributable to an extra segment of genome in a tandem duplication covering the c and d sites. The first of these inhomologies produces a lowered efficiency of transfer from all configurations of the particular d allele associated with the mutant c marker, and therefore accounts for the characteristic transfer patterns even from the native merodiploid DNA's.</td></tr></table></div>

BCCP(10,400), with a molecular weight of 10,400, has a <span class="DISEASE">CD</span> spectrum intermediate between <span class="CHEMICAL">BCCP</span> and that of the smallest peptides. Since d-biotin exhibits a positive <span class="DISEASE">CD</span> band at 233 nm, it was suspected that the biotin prosthetic group might be the chromophore responsible for the 237 nm <span class="DISEASE">CD</span> band seen in BCCP(SC) and BCCP(9,100). Enzymatic carboxylation of BCCP(SC) to form CO2-BCCP(SC) caused the <span class="DISEASE">CD</span> spectrum to change with a shift of the 237 nm band to 232 nm. The positive <span class="DISEASE">CD</span> band at 220 nm was unaffected by carboxylation of the biotin prosthetic group. These date suggest that the 237 nm signal may be due either to the biotin which acts as a chromophore directly or to a chromophore that is perturbed by the carboxylation of biotin. A spectropolarimetric titration was carried out to investigate the possible contribution of the single tyrosine residue of BCCP(SC) to the <span class="DISEASE">CD</span> spectrum of this peptide. At pH values over 9 the <span class="DISEASE">CD</span> spetrum changed with the disappearance of the 237 nm band, suggesting that tyrosine might contribute to this <span class="DISEASE">CD</span> band. Denaturation of BCCP(SC) or BCCP(9,100) with 8 M urea of 6 M guanidine HCl abolished the positive <span class="DISEASE">CD</span> bands and resulted in spectra typical of a random coil, whereas treatment of BCCP(SC) with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate abolished the positive bands and left a spectrum exhibiting a shoulder at 222 nm and a negative band at 205 nm, suggestive of a high degree of ordered structure. It is concluded that the <span class="DISEASE">CD</span> band at 237 nm in BCCP(SC) and BCCP(9,100) is prabably due to a noncovalent interaction of biotin with an amino acid residue(s) of the protein. It is suggested that the biotin prosthetic group is partially buried in the surface of the protein, rather than swinging free at the end of the lysine side chain through which it is covalently linked to the protein, to permit this interaction to occur.</td></tr></table></div>

Testes from <span class="DISEASE">cryptorchid</span> and control newborn and adult mice were investigated with radioimmunoassay and electron microscopy. It was concluded that a normal Leydig cell function plays a decisive role in testicular descent. In cryptorchidism, Leydig cells at birth are atrophic. Testicular testosterone content is diminished as compared to controls. Ultrastructural alterations of Leydig cells observed in our experiments closely resemble those found in biopsies of <span class="DISEASE">cryptorchid</span> patients. In male mouse offspring, prenatal <span class="CHEMICAL">estrogen</span> injection induced not only a cryptorchidism but also Leydig cell atrophy and a permanently impaired function. Testosterone content is still significantly diminished after puberty. It is proposed therefore that an insufficiency of endocrine gonadal function of hypothalamo-pituitary origin occurring during intrauterine development is one of the main causes of cryptorchidism. An appropriate long-term therapy could diminish the high sterility rate.</td></tr></table></div>

The in vivo administration of the radiolabeled lung toxin alpha-naphthylthiourea (ANTU) to rats leads to the covalent binding of radioactivity to the macromolecules of the lung and liver. In contrast, very little radioactivity is bound in these organs when an equal amount of the 14C-labeled oxygen analog of <span class="CHEMICAL">ANTU</span>, 14C-alpha-naphthylurea (ANU), is administered. In addition, ANU is essentially nontoxic to rats. <span class="CHEMICAL">ANTU</span> is metabolized in vitro by lung and liver microsomes to an intermediate which covalently binds to the macromolecules of the microsomes. This covalent binding, which requires NADPH, leads to a decrease in mixed-function oxidase activity and to a decrease in the level of cytochrome P-450 detectable as its carbon monoxide complex. Incubation of microsomes with <span class="CHEMICAL">ANTU</span> in the absence of NADPH or with ANU in the presence of NADPH, has no effect on these parameters. Pretreatment of rats with small nonlethal doses of <span class="CHEMICAL">ANTU</span> daily for 5 days brings about a decrease in the activity of the mixed-function oxidase enzyme system in the lung which metabolizes parathion.

Concurrent inhibition of transferred KLH-specific CBH and systemic passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reactions by rabbit IgG or its Fc fragment, and not by sheep or bovine gamma-globulins, indicated that Fc receptors on cutaneous mast cells were probably involved in both CBH and PCA.

Concomitantly with or closely following the intrauterine death of their litters, a large proportion of pregnant rats died with histologically evident DIC. Administration of cortisone, heparin, or disoumarin did not prevent DIC, and xi-aminocaproic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, or an onion-rich diet tended to increase its incidence. Antibiotic regimens gave variable results, with significant decrease in DIC only with a combination of two wide-spectrum penicillins. <span class="CHEMICAL">neomycin</span> and polymyxin had little effect on susceptible Sprague-dawley derived rats, but polymxin caused a significant increase in DIC in a resistant strain of hooded rats. Fatal maternal DIC was completely prevented only by use of natural or synthetic estrogens concurrently with progesterone, although this did not alter the sequence of abnormally prolonged pregnacy with intrauterine fetal death and retention of dead fetuses. Potencies of estrogens varied greatly, but all compounds tested prevented DIC at adequate dosage levels. Diethylstilbestrol, the most potent drug tested, was completely protective at 1 mug daily given subcutaneously. beta-Estradiol was the most effective natural estrogen, giving complete protection with a 10-mug daily subcutaneous injection. Estrogens were much more potent by subcutaneous injection than by oral ingestion, and toxic side effects were sometimes noted with higher levels of the latter.

Adrenalectomy and hypophysectomy showed similar response rates. Until it can be shown that hypophysectomy clearly offers enhanced benefits, this will not be utilized by our group except in those patients who cannot tolerate abdominal surgery (that is, patients with poor pulmonary reserve). Of interest is the high response rate (65 per cent) to ablative treatment in patients in whom disease exacerbates on additive hormonal treatment, with an increased duration of response and survival. Survival is increased in patients who are rebound responders after <span class="CHEMICAL">estrogen</span> withdrawal. We expect to report data with future follow-up of this group of patients.

The role of acidity in determining and restricting plant distribution and performance is discussed. In soils especially, a key effect of H+ ion concentration is on the solubility of potentially toxic heavy metals such as aluminum, managenese, zinc, iron, copper, and nickel. Al has been reported from many studies since the 1920's as the key determining toxic factor in acid soils. Some  acid-tolerant species have been shown to be especially tolerant of Al, and mechanisms of tolerance have been suggested. <span class="CHEMICAL">mn</span> is also a commonly toxic factor at soil pH less than 5.0. Calcium has been shown to alleviate <span class="CHEMICAL">mn</span> <span class="DISEASE">toxicity</span>. Low pH soils are also generally low in Ca, K, Na, and P; all essential major elements for plant growth. In lakes and marine situations acidic waters are uncommon as the waters are buffered. Calcium is again ameliorative of metal toxicities. The pH, redox, and valency state are critical in determining nutrient availability and metal speciation. Recent increases in the H+ ion content of precipitation have caused increased acidities of freshwater lakes in Scandinavia and eastern North America, which have depleted biota, including fish populations.</td></tr></table></div>

Gradual blocking of the electron transport with 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea resulted in diminution and ultimate elimination of the biphasic nature of the signal without reducing the extent of the absorbance change or of the dark kinetics.

Signal I is pH independent, whereas Signal II demonstrates a strong pH dependence, parallel to the O2-evolving capacity of the cells. Chloroplast particles isolated from the wild type Scenedesmus cells demonstrated in the absence of any added artificial electron donor or acceptor and also under non-phosphorylation conditions the 520 nm absorbance change with approximately the same magnitude as whole cells. The dark kinetics of the particles were comparatively slower. Removal of plastocyanin and other electron carriers by washing with Triton X-100 slowed down the kinetics of the dark reversal reaction to a greater extent.

<div class='SUBSTRATE'><table><tr><td>Pyridine-2, 6-dicarboxylic acid (dipicolinic acid) formation in Bacillus subtilis. II Non-enzymatic and enzymatic formations of dipicolinic acid from alpha, epsilon-diketopimelic acid and ammonia. Non-enzymatic formation of dipicolinic acid (DPA) from diketopimelic acid and ammonia was clearly demonstrated using a new method for DPA analysis. The reaction rates of DPA formation were almost the same under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Nearly equimolecular quantities of DPA and tetrahydrodipicolinic acid were detected in spontaneous reaction mixture. The spontaneous reaction seemed to be due to dismutation of dihydrodipicolinic acid, resulting in DPA and tetrahydrodipicolinic acid. The apparent optimum pH of the spontaneous reaction was 8.2 and the maximal rate of DPA formation was observed with a 1 : 4 molar ratio of diketopimelic acid to ammonia. The rate of the spontaneous reaction was stimulated by ferrous sulfate, FMN, and riboflavin. Dihydrodipicolinate <span class="GENE">reductase</span> catalyzes the reduction of dihydrodipicolinate, prepared from pyruvate and aspartic beta-semialdehyde, with NADPH as reductant. The <span class="GENE">reductase</span> was isolated from Bacillus subtilis, and found to stimulate DPA formation from diketopimelic acid and ammonia. The enzymatic DPA formation was absolutely dependent on <span class="CHEMICAL">oxygen</span>, and optimum pH was 6.4. The catalytic action of the enzyme was similar to that of the oxidase. Possible mechanisms of DPA formation from diketopimelic acid and ammonia are proposed.</td></tr></table></div>

Glucose uptake by whole-cell suspensions of the obligate anaerobe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was two- to fourfold higher under aerobic conditions than during incubation under atmospheres of N(2) or H(2) gas. The O(2)-stimulated uptake activity was lost rapidly (&gt;70% in 5 h) when <span class="GENE">cell</span> suspensions were incubated aerobically, but this loss was prevented by the addition of crude catalase.

Chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and gel filtration on Sephadex revealed that pyrazon dioxygenase from pyrazon-degrading bacteria consists of three different enzyme components. No component alone oxidizes the phenyl moiety of pyrazon, only when the three components are combined can oxidation be detected. Following electron paramagnetic resonance and ultraviolet measurements the protein nature of the three components was determined: component A1 (molecular weight about 180000,red-brown in colour) is an iron-sulphur protein. The existence of approximately two moles of <span class="CHEMICAL">iron</span> and two moles of inorganic sulphur per mole of protein was demonstrated. This enzyme component was purified to homogeneity in disc electrophoresis. Component A2 is a yellow protein of a molecular weight of about 67000.

Component B (molecular weight about 12000, brown in colour) is a protein of the ferredoxin type, which was purified to homogeneity, as demonstrated by disc electrophoresis. A hypothetical scheme for the cooperation of the three components is proposed: component A2 accepts as cosubstrate NADH and functions as a ferredoxin reductase.

The depression occurred despite the fact that the chicks continued to eat up until the time they were killed. Under these same conditions, the hepatic activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2) was not affected by HgCl2, while the activity of the mitochondrial system of fatty acid elongation was stimulated. (2) When 2-mercaptoethanol was included in the incubation medium for a highly purified preparation of <span class="GENE">fatty acid synthetase</span>, 500 muM HgCl2 was required to show definite inhibition of the enzyme.

When dithiothreitol was added after the addition of enzyme to the mercury-containing medium, protection of the enzyme was not complete.

The optimal pH for <span class="GENE">enzyme</span> activity is 8.0. The molecular weight of the <span class="GENE">enzyme</span> was calculated to be 116,000, based on measurements of the sedimentation coefficient by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and the Stokes radius by gel filtration. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cross-linked OTCase in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate showed that the <span class="GENE">enzyme</span> is composed of three identical subunits. The molecular weight of the monomer was determined to be 39,000. Steady-state kinetics indicate that the reaction mechanism is sequential. The limiting Michealis constants for carbamylphosphate and <span class="CHEMICAL">ornithine</span> were determined to be 0.06 and 0.2 mM, respectively. The dissociation constant for carbamylphosphate was 0.02 mM. Product and dead-end inhibition patterns are consistent with an ordered Bi Bi mechanism, in which carbamylphosphate is the first substrate added and phosphate is the last product released. OTCase activity was inhibited by arginine, but relatively high concentrations were required for significant inhibition. The inhibition by arginine might be physiologically significant in the regulation of carbamlphosphate utilization; a single carbamylphosphate synthetase is responsible for the synthesis of carbamylphosphate for both arginine and pyrimidines in S. typhimurium and the inhibition by argine might serve to divert carbamlphosphate to the synthesis of pyrimidines when arginine is present at high concentrations. The crossreaction of OTCases from different microorganisms with purified antibodies raised against the homogeneous OTCase from S. typhimurium was investigated. The results of immunotitration and immunodiffusion experiments revealed a high degree of identity between the enzymes form S. typhimurium and Esherichia coli B and W. In these three cases, a single gen (argl) encodes OTCase. Wild-type E. coli K-12 and strain 3000 X 111, which carry two OTCase genes (argI, argF), also revealed similar cross-reactivity, supporting the hypothesis that argF is the product of a relatively recent duplication. The activity of OTCase from Bacillus subtilis was partially inhibited by antibodies against the <span class="GENE">enzyme</span> from S. typhimurium, indicating unusual conservation of primary structure among widely different taxonomic groups. OTCase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whose molecular weight and primary structure are similar to those of the <span class="GENE">enzyme</span> from S. typhimurium, was without detectable cross-reactivity.</td></tr></table></div>

Systematic analysis of the hydrolysis of benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)-dipeptides by cathepsin A [<span class="GENE">EC 3.4.12.1</span>] purified from rat liver lysosomes showed that multiple forms of cathepsin A preferentially cleave peptide bonds with leucine, methionine, and phenylalanine. Cbz-Met-Met, -Met-Phe, -Phe-Met, and -Phe-Ala were hydrolyzed 6 to 8 times faster than the standard substrates, Cbz-Glu-Phe and Cbz-Glu-Tyr. The pH optima of the hydrolyses were 4.6 to 5.8. Hydrolysis of peptide bonds with <span class="CHEMICAL">glycine</span>, isoleucine, and proline was very slow, but the rate depended on the nature of the adjacent amino acids. Proteins such as albumin, cytochrome c, gamma-globulin, hemoglobin, histone, myoglobin, and myosin were scarecely degraded. Peptide hormones, such as glucagon and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were hydrolyzed markedly with optimum pH's of 4.5 and 4.6, respectively. Angiotensin I, II, bradykinin, Lys- and Met-Lysbradykinin (kallidin and Met-kallidin), and substance P were also hydrolyzed at appreciable rates. pH optima for these peptide hormones were 5.2 to 5.6. On the other hand, insulin and its A chain, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH), oxytocin and vasopressin were cleaved slowly. In the hydrolyses of glucagon and other peptides, multiple forms of rat liver lysosomal cathepsin A again showed a carboxypeptidase nature, cleaving peptide bonds sequentially from the carboxyl terminal. Almost all of the amino acids were cleaved on prolonged incubation. Vaso-activites of angiotensin II and bradykinin were rapidly lost on hydrolysis by cathepsin A. Lysosomal cathepsin C [dipeptidylaminopeptidase I, EC 3.4.14.1] also activated angiotensin II, but did not inactive bradykinin. Cathepsin A, therefore, can be regarded as one of the lysosomal angiotensinases and kinases. No distinct differences were observed between the multiple forms of cathepsin A in these hydrolyses and inactivations of peptides.</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='SUBSTRATE'><table><tr><td>Mechanism of inhibition of <span class="CHEMICAL">chromatium d</span> growth by L-methionine. Regulation of L-threonine biosynthesis by the intracellular level of S-adenosylmethionine. (1) An unusual accumulation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine in <span class="CHEMICAL">chromatium d</span> was associated with a marked growth inhibition by L-methionine. The inhibition was overcome by L-isoleucine, L-leucine, L-phyenylalanine, L-threonine, L-valine and putrescien. Based on their effects, these compounds are classified into 3 types. (2) L-Isoleucine, L-leucine, L-phyenylalanine and L-valine (Type I) inhibited the L-methionine uptake and consequently prevented the bacterium from the unusual accumulation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine even in the presence of L-methionine in the medium. Putrescine (Type II) stimulated the consumption of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, but did not influence the L-methionine uptake. Hence, the effect of putrescine would be explained by the action to diminish the intracellular level of S-adenosyl-L-methionine. L-Threonine (Type III) neither inhibited the L-methionine uptake nor affected the content of S-adenoxyl-L-methionine due to the addition of L-methionine. (3) The specific activity of homoserine kinase (<span class="GENE">EC 2.7.1.39</span>) was greatly lowered by the addition of L-methionine under conditions in which <span class="CHEMICAL">chromatium d</span> unusually accumulates S-adenoxyl-L-methionine. Homoserine dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.3) activity was inhbitied by S-adenosyl-L-methionine (50% inhibition index, 3.5 mM). These facts strongly suggest that the growth inhibition by L-methionine is associated with the L-threonine deficiency caused by the unusual accumulation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='SUBSTRATE'><table><tr><td>The biological fate of reserpine. Orally administered reserpine is readily absorbed from the GI tract. During this process at least a portion of the drug is metabolized by the intestinal mucosa and then presumably is acted upon by <span class="GENE">serum esterases</span>. Methylreserpate and trimethoxybenzoic acid are the primary metabolites which result from the hydrolytic cleavage of reserpine. Since most of the blood leaving the GI tract passes through the liver via the portal vein, hepatic metabolism would also be expected to reduce reserpine levels in the blood. The relative contributions of <span class="GENE">serum esterases</span> versus hepatic metabolism in the biotransformation of reserpine in vivo are not known. However, very little unmetabolized reserpine is eventually eliminated in the urine. In the liver, it is quite likely that both microsomal oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes contribute to the metabolism of reserpine. It seems that microsomal oxidation (such as the demethylation of the 4-methoxy group on the TMBA moiety) must precede hydrolysis since inhibition of demethylation markedly reduces the rate of hydrolysis. In addition to oxidation and hydrolysis, conjugative reactions also must occur in liver or extrahepatic tissues since both <span class="CHEMICAL">glucuronide</span> and sulfate conjugates of TMBA have been identified. Some reserpine molecules do seem to escape metabolism, however, since significant amounts of intact reserpine have been found in fecal samples taken from both experimental animals and human beings after either oral or parenteral drug administration. Presumably reserpine is transported from the blood via the biliary tree into the small intestine where it is either reabsorbed or eliminated in the feces. Pulmonary elimination of CO2 produced after complete oxidation of the 4-methoxy group of TMBA has also been shown to occur both in vivo and in vitro. The following may serve as a model for the relationship between the subcellular distribution of reserpine and its site of action. After a single intravenous injection most of the reserpine, probably loosely bound to plasma albumin, is distributed to tissues on the basis of their blood flow. Because of its lipophilic properties, reserpine would easily penetrate cell membranes and then bind possibly electrostatically to intracellular membrane components, particularly those rich in phospholipids. Much of the circulating reserpine would then either be metabolized or be taken up by the lipid depots of the body, leading to a rapid redistribution of the reversibly bound reserpine from the tissues. During this time a relatively small fraction of the total reserpine administered by injection would become associated with monoaminergic granular membranes in a more specific and irreversible manner. This would result in a persistent, nonstoichiometric inhibition of monoamine uptake. Such a small specific binding would not be detectable for at least 18 hr after reserpine administration, i.e., until most of the reversibly bound alkaloid had been metabolized and/or excreted...</td></tr></table></div>

The native enzyme exhibits a biphasic time-course of inactivation by mercurochrome with second-order rate constants 1.62 x 10(4) M-1 - min-1 and 2.15 x 10(3) M-1 - min-1, whereas the modified enzyme is inactivated more slowly (second-order rate constant 6.1 x 10(2) M-1 - min-1) under the same conditions. The inhibitor inactivates native and modified enzyme in the absence as well as in the presence of substrates. Mercurochrome-transaminase interaction is accompanied by a red shift in the absorption maximum of the fluorochrome of about 10 nm. Difference spectra of the mercurochrome-enzyme system versus mercurochrome, compared with analogous spectra of mercurochrome-ethanol, revealed that the spectral shifts recorded during mercurochrome-transaminase interaction are similar to those that occur when mercurochrome is dissolved in non-polar solvents. Studies of mercurochrome complexes with native or modified transaminase, isolated by chromatography on Sephadex G-25, revealed that native transaminase is able to conjugate with four mercurochrome molecules per molecule, but the modified enzyme is able to conjugate with only two mercurochrome molecules per molecule.</td></tr></table></div>

The molecular weight of the enzymes were estimated by the elution volumes from a Sephadex G-100 column and were found to be about 43,000 (isoenzyme 1) and 69,000 (isoenzyme 2).

<div class='SUBSTRATE'><table><tr><td>Indomethacin stimulation of lipid peroxidation and chemiluminescense in rat liver microsomes. Peroxidation of endogenous lipid by liver microsomes, coupled with oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive materials, is markedly stimulated in the presence of indomethacin [1-(p-chlorobenzyl)-5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-indole acetic acid] (0.1--1.0 mM). Concurrently, indomethacin enhances the lipolysis of membrane phospholipid containing arachidonic acid but has no effect on the rate of O2 uptake in these samples. The system generates a rapidly developed chemiliminescense (CL), the intensity and rate of development of which are related to indomethacin concentration. The microsomal CL generated in the presence of indomethacin is distinct from the previously reported CL in that the time required for maximum intensity development is a matter of seconds (20--180) rather than hours. The enhanced CL is believed to be due to an energy transfer reaction whereby a high energy species transfers energy to the indomethacin molecule, which, in turn, decays via chemiluminescense. An enhanced chemiluminescense was also observed when indomethacin was added to a <span class="GENE">lipoxidase</span> system and <span class="CHEMICAL">superoxide</span> generating system (axanthine oxidase). Based on inhibitor studies, the rapidly developed chemiluminescense of the microsomal system requires cytochrome P-450 in addition to NADPH and coordinated iron ions.

Poor induction of the enzymes of the <span class="CHEMICAL">glyoxylate</span> cycle, <span class="GENE">isocitrate lyase</span> and malate synthase in mutants lacking acetyl-CoA synthase, and also in the other two classes of fluoroacetate-resistant mutants, indicates that the inducer, acetate, may be metabolized to a true metabolic inducer, perhaps acetyl-CoA, to effect formation of the enzymes.

Systematic analysis of the hydrolysis of benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)-dipeptides by cathepsin A [EC 3.4.12.1] purified from rat liver lysosomes showed that multiple forms of cathepsin A preferentially cleave peptide bonds with leucine, methionine, and phenylalanine. Cbz-Met-Met, -Met-Phe, -Phe-Met, and -Phe-Ala were hydrolyzed 6 to 8 times faster than the standard substrates, Cbz-Glu-Phe and Cbz-Glu-Tyr. The pH optima of the hydrolyses were 4.6 to 5.8. Hydrolysis of peptide bonds with glycine, <span class="CHEMICAL">isoleucine</span>, and proline was very slow, but the rate depended on the nature of the adjacent amino acids. Proteins such as albumin, cytochrome c, gamma-globulin, hemoglobin, histone, myoglobin, and myosin were scarecely degraded.

Angiotensin I, II, bradykinin, Lys- and Met-Lysbradykinin (kallidin and Met-kallidin), and substance P were also hydrolyzed at appreciable rates. pH optima for these peptide hormones were 5.2 to 5.6. On the other hand, insulin and its A chain, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH), oxytocin and vasopressin were cleaved slowly. In the hydrolyses of glucagon and other peptides, multiple forms of rat liver lysosomal cathepsin A again showed a <span class="GENE">carboxypeptidase</span> nature, cleaving peptide bonds sequentially from the carboxyl terminal.

<div class='SUBSTRATE'><table><tr><td>Studies on cathepsins of rat liver lysosomes. III. Hydrolysis of peptides, and inactivation of <span class="GENE">angiotensin</span> and bradykinin by cathepsin A. Systematic analysis of the hydrolysis of benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)-dipeptides by cathepsin A [EC 3.4.12.1] purified from rat liver lysosomes showed that multiple forms of cathepsin A preferentially cleave peptide bonds with leucine, methionine, and phenylalanine. Cbz-Met-Met, -Met-Phe, -Phe-Met, and -Phe-Ala were hydrolyzed 6 to 8 times faster than the standard substrates, Cbz-Glu-Phe and Cbz-Glu-Tyr. The pH optima of the hydrolyses were 4.6 to 5.8. Hydrolysis of peptide bonds with glycine, <span class="CHEMICAL">isoleucine</span>, and proline was very slow, but the rate depended on the nature of the adjacent amino acids. Proteins such as albumin, cytochrome c, gamma-globulin, hemoglobin, histone, myoglobin, and myosin were scarecely degraded. Peptide hormones, such as glucagon and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were hydrolyzed markedly with optimum pH's of 4.5 and 4.6, respectively. <span class="GENE">angiotensin</span> I, II, bradykinin, Lys- and Met-Lysbradykinin (kallidin and Met-kallidin), and substance P were also hydrolyzed at appreciable rates. pH optima for these peptide hormones were 5.2 to 5.6. On the other hand, insulin and its A chain, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH), oxytocin and vasopressin were cleaved slowly. In the hydrolyses of glucagon and other peptides, multiple forms of rat liver lysosomal cathepsin A again showed a carboxypeptidase nature, cleaving peptide bonds sequentially from the carboxyl terminal. Almost all of the amino acids were cleaved on prolonged incubation. Vaso-activites of <span class="GENE">angiotensin</span> II and bradykinin were rapidly lost on hydrolysis by cathepsin A. Lysosomal cathepsin C [dipeptidylaminopeptidase I, EC 3.4.14.1] also activated <span class="GENE">angiotensin</span> II, but did not inactive bradykinin. Cathepsin A, therefore, can be regarded as one of the lysosomal angiotensinases and kinases. No distinct differences were observed between the multiple forms of cathepsin A in these hydrolyses and inactivations of peptides.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='SUBSTRATE'><table><tr><td><span class="CHEMICAL">cation</span> transport in Escherichia coli. VIII. Potassium transport mutants. Analysis of K transport mutants indicates the existence of four separate K uptake systems in Escherichia coli K-12. A high affinity system called Kdp has a Km of 2 muM, and Vmax at 37 degrees C of 150 mumol/g min. This system is repressed by growth in high concentrations of K. Two constitutive systems, TrkA and TrkD, have Km's of 1.5 and 0.5 mM and Vmax's of 550 and 40 at 37 and 30 degrees C, respectively. Mutants lacking all three of these saturable systems take up K slowly by a process, called TrkF, whose rate of transport is linearly dependent on K concentration up to 105 mM. On the whole, each of these systems appears to function as an independent path for K uptake since the kinetics of uptake when two are present is the sum of each operating alone. This is not true for strains having both the TrkD and Kdp systems, where presence of the latter results in K uptake which saturates at a K concentration well below 0.1 mM. This result indicates some interaction between these systems so that uptake now has the affinity characteristic of the Kdp system. All transport systems are able to extrude Na during K uptake. The measurements of cell Na suggest that growing <span class="GENE">cells</span> of E. coli have very low concentrations of Na, considerably lower than indicated by earlier studies.</td></tr></table></div>

The effects of divalent salts and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) upon nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) reduction and P700 in isolated chloroplasts are described and compared with the influence of DCMU on oxygen evolution and P700 in intact <span class="GENE">cells</span>. Most experiments were carried out with a steady-state relaxation spectrometer. A kinetic mechanism for the estimation of P700 fluxes is proposed and experimentally tested. Good agreement between theory and experiment was found. Concurrent measurements of P700 and NADP reduction revealed two antagonisms: addition of divalent cations caused an increase in the yield of NADP reduction and a decrease in the yield of P700. Conversely, in the presence of Mg2+ low concentrations of DCMU decreased the yield of NADP reduction and increased the yield of P700. Aging of the chloroplasts at 30 degrees C exerted a similar effect. With far-red actinic light, Mg2+ stimulated the yield of NADP reduction without affecting the flux. Also, in the absence of Mg2+, DCMU inhibited both reactions although P700 required a higher herbicide concentration for fractional inhibition than NADP reduction. In the presence of Mg2+, chloroplasts resembled intact algae in which a high rate of oxygen evolution was accompanied by little P700 turn-over. Titration with DCMU decreased the rate of photosynthesis and increased P700 flux.

Use of F' plasmids helped to discriminate metabolic blocks in P. fluorescens. In particular, metA, metB, and argH mutants were so distinguished. In addition, F131 plasmid carrying the his operon and a supD mutation could partially relieve the auxotrophy of thr, ilv, and metA13 mutants, suggesting functional expression of E. coli tRNA in P. fluorescens. In P. fluorescens metA Rifr mutants carrying the F110 plasmid, which carried the E. coli metA gene and the E. coli rifs allele, sensitivity to <span class="CHEMICAL">rifampin</span> was found to be dominant at least temporarily over resistance.

<div class='SUBSTRATE'><table><tr><td>Properties of glutathione release observed during reduction of organic <span class="CHEMICAL">hydroperoxide</span>, demethylation of aminopyrine and oxidation of some substances in perfused rat liver, and their implications for the physiological function of catalase. The enhanced reduction of t-butyl <span class="CHEMICAL">hydroperoxide</span> by glutathione peroxidase is accompanied by a decrease in the cellular concentration of both glutathione and NADPH in isolated liver <span class="GENE">cells</span>, resulting in the release of GSSG (oxidized glutathione) from the perfused rat liver. This phenomenon, first reported by H. Sies, C. Gerstenecker, H. Menzel &amp; L. Flohe (1972) (FEBS Lett. 27, 171-175), can be observed under a variety of conditions, not only with the acceleration of the glutathione peroxidase reaction by organic peroxides, but also during the oxidation of glycollate and benzylamine, during demethylation of aminopyrine in the liver of the phenobarbital-pretreated rat and during oxidation of uric acid in the liver of the starved rat pretreated with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The rate of release of GSSG is altered markedly by changes in the metabolic conditions which affect the rate of hepatic NADPH generation. Thus, regardless of whether achieved by enhanced oxidation of glutathione by glutathione peroxidase or by oxidation of NADPH through other metabolic pathways, an increase in the cellular concentration of GSSG appears to facilitate its release. It has been found that, in addition to the hexose monophosphate shunt, the mitochondrial NADH-NADP+ transhydrogenase reaction plays an important role in supplying reducing equivalents to the glutathione peroxidase reaction and in maintaining the cellular oxidation-reduction state of the nicotinamide nucleotides. Spectrophotometric analysis of the steady-state concentration of the catalase-H2O2 intermediate with simultaneous measurement of the rate of release of GSSG leads to the conclusion that intracellular compartmentation of catalase in the peroxisomes and glutathione peroxidase in the cytosol and mitochondria distinguishes the reactivities of these enzymes one from the other, and facilitates their effective cooperation in <span class="CHEMICAL">hydroperoxide</span> metabolism in the liver.</td></tr></table></div>

"Amphiphilic" drugs from completely different pharmacological groups, like chloroquine, <span class="CHEMICAL">amiodarone</span>, chlorpromazine form complexes with cellular phospholipids which cannot be metabolised by <span class="GENE">lysosomal phospholipases</span>. Thus in all tissues with high phospholipid content or turnover typical intracellular deposites with lamellary or crystalloid structure may occur (myelin figures). Such deposites were observed in different parts of the eye and are known e.g. from the cornea as "cornea verticillata".</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='SUBSTRATE'><table><tr><td>Enzyme inactivation by a cellular neutral protease: enzyme specificity, effects of ligands on inactivation, and implications for the regulation of enzyme degradation. A protease from Tetrahymena pyriformis inactivated eight of nine commercially available enzymes tested, including <span class="GENE">lactate deyhdrogenase</span>, <span class="CHEMICAL">isocitrate</span> dehydrogenase (TPN-specific), glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase, D-amino acid oxidase, fumarase, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase, and citrate synthase. Urate oxidase was not inactivated. Inactivation occurred at neutral pH, was prevented by inhibitors of the protease, and followed first order kinetics. In those cases tested, inactivation was enhanced by mercaptoethanol. Most of the enzyme-inactivating activity was due to a protease of molecular weight 25,000 that eluted from DEAE-Sephadex at 0.3 M KCl. A second protease of this molecular weight, which was not retained by the gel, inactivated only <span class="CHEMICAL">isocitrate</span> dehydrogenase and D-amino acid oxidase. These two proteases could also be distinguished by temperature and inhibitor sensitivity. Two other protease peaks obtained by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography had little or no no enzyme inactivating activity, while another attacked only D-amino acid oxidase. At least six of the enzymes could be protected from proteolytic inactivation by various ligands. Isocitrates dehydrogenase was protected by <span class="CHEMICAL">isocitrate</span>, TPN, or TPNH, glucose-6-dehydrogenase by glucose-6-P or TPN, pyruvate kinase by phosphoenolypyruvate or ADP, hexokinase by glucose, and fumarase by a mixture of fumarate and malate. Lactate dehdrogenase was not protected by either of its substrates of coenzymes. Citrate synthase was probably protected by oxalacetate. Our data suggest that the protease or proteases discussed here may participate in the inactivation or degradation of a least some enzymes in Tetrahymena. Since the inactivation occurs at neutral pH, this process could be regulated by variations in the cellular levels of substrates, coenzymes, or allosteric regulators resulting form changes in growth conditions or growth state. Such a mechanism would permit the selective retention of enzymes of metabolically active pathways.</td></tr></table></div>

Fixation of purified sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane vesicles, using glutaraldehyde supplemented with 1% tannic acid, reveals newly visualized ultrastructure in thin sections. The trilaminar appearance of the membrane is highly asymmetric; the outer electron-opaque layer is appreciably wider (70 A) than the inner layer (20 A). The asymmetry is not referable to lack of penetration of the tannic acid since: (a) SR vesicles made permeable with 1 mM <span class="CHEMICAL">EDTA</span>, pH 8.5, show similar asymmetry; (b) treatment of SR with <span class="GENE">trypsin</span> results in progressive loss in protein content and decrease in the thickness of the outer layer, until in the limit the trilayer has a symmetric appearance; (c) within the same muscle section, the SR membrane appears highly asymmetric whereas the sarcolemma has a more symmetric appearance; (d) reconstituted SR vesicles have a symmetric appearance with equally broad inner and outer layers (approximately 70 A); the symmetric structure is confirmed by freeze-fracture and negative staining electron microscopy. Heavy and light SR vesicles obtained by isopycnic density sedimentation of purified SR have the same asymmetric appearance of the membrane and seem to differ mainly in that the heavy vesicles contain internal contents consisting largely of Ca++-binding protein. The asymmetry of the SR membrane is referable mainly to the unidirectional alignment of the Ca++ pump protein, the major component (90% of the protein) of the membrane. The asymmetry of the SR membrane can be visualized now for the first time in situ in thin sections of muscle.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='SUBSTRATE'><table><tr><td>Role of protein dissociation in the transport of acidic amino acids by the Ehrlich ascites tumor <span class="GENE">cell</span>. The pH profile for the uptake of L-glutamic acid by the Ehrlich ascites tumor <span class="GENE">cell</span> arises largely as a sum of the decline with falling pH of a slow, Na+-dependent uptake by System A, and an increasing uptake by Na+-independent System L. The latter maximizes at about pH 4.5, following approximately the titration curve of the distal <span class="CHEMICAL">carboxyl</span> group. This shift in route of uptake was verified by (a) a declining Na+-dependent component, (b) an almost corresponding decline in the 2-(methylamino)-isobutyric acid-inhibitable component, (c) a rising component inhibited by 2-aminonorbornane-2-carboxylic acid. Other amino acids recognized as principally reactive with Systems A or L yielded corresponding inhibitory effects with some conspicious exceptions: 2-Aminoisobutyric acid and even glycine become better substrates of System L as the pH is lowered; hence their inhibitory action on glutamic acid uptake is not lost. The above results were characterized by generally consistent relations among the half-saturation concentrations of the interacting amino acids with respect to: their own uptake, their inhibition of the uptake, one by another, and their trans stimulation of exodus, one by another. A small Na+-dependent component of uptake retained by L-glutamic acid but not by D-glutamic acid at pH 4.5 is inhibitable by methionine but by neither 2-(methylamino)-isobutyric acid nor the norbornane amino acid. We provisionally identified this component with System ASC, which transports L-glutamine throughout the pH range studied. No transport activity specific to the anionic amino acids was detected, and the unequivocally anionic cysteic acid showed neither significant mediated uptake nor inhibition of the uptake of glutamic aic or of the norbornane amino acid. The dicarboxylic amino acids take the sequence, aspartic acid less than glutamic acid less than alpha-aminoadipic acid less than S-carboxymethylcysteine, in their rate of mediated, Na+-independent uptake at low pH. Diiodotyrosine and two dissimilas isomers  of nitrotyrosine also show acceleration of uptake as the phenolate group on the sidechain is protonated, a result indicating that the acidic group need not be a <span class="CHEMICAL">carboxyl</span> group and need not take a specific position in space to be accepted at the receptor site L. The presence of the <span class="CHEMICAL">carboxyl</span> group does not upset the normal stereospecificity of System L until it falls on the beta-carbon in aspartic acid; even then it is the presence of the carbonyl group and not of the intact <span class="CHEMICAL">carboxyl</span> group nor of its hydroxyl group that cancels out the stereospecificity, as was shown by the absence of normal stereospecificity for aspartic acid and asparagine and its presence in glutamic acid, homoserine and glutamine. In agreement, the uptak of aspartic acid is peculiarly sensitive to the presence of an alpha-methyl group or of other structures that modify the orientation of the sidechain.</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='SUBSTRATE'><table><tr><td>Cardiac atrial myosin adenosine triphosphatase of animals and humans: distinctive enzymatic properties compared with cardiac ventricular myosin. Cardiac myosin obtained from atria had a higher Ca2+-activated ATPase activity than did cardiac myosin from ventricles in various species of animals and in humans. The increased specific activity of Ca2+-activated adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) of atrial myosin appeared to correlate with the level of the activity of ventricular myosin ATPase in the animal, since the same order in ATPase activity, as observed in ventricular myosins from various animals, was noted in atrial myosins. The enzymatic properties of atrial myosin also were characterized by no activation by N-ethylmaleimide, low activating energy, and a lower rate of inactivation at alkaline pH compared with the same properties of ventricular myosin. These findings suggest a difference in the myosin molecule at or near the active site, involving some sulfhydryl groups, between the two types of cardiac myosin. The Mg2+-activated ATPase activity, both in the presence and absence of <span class="GENE">actin</span> (which is thought to be closely related to the basic contraction mechanism), also was enhanced in atrial myosin. Thus, the ATPase activities of atrial and ventricular myosins were different with special reference to the reaction pathway involving <span class="CHEMICAL">calcium</span> and magnesium ions and appear to account for the difference in the velocity of contraction between the atria and the ventricles.</td></tr></table></div>

These isolated heterocysts accounted for up to 34% of the acetylene-reducing activity of whole filaments and had a specific activity of up to 1,560 nmol of C2H4 formed per mg of heterocyst chlorphyll per min. Activity of glutamine synthetase was coupled to activity of nitrogenase in isolated heterocysts as shown by acetylene-inhibitable formation of [13N]NH3 and of amidelabeled [13N]glutamine form [13N]N2. A method is also described for the production of 6-mCi amounts of [13N]NH3.

Methionine sulfoximine strongly inhibited these syntheses. Glutamate synthase is, after nitrogenase and glutamine synthetase, the third sequential <span class="GENE">enzyme</span> involved in the assimilation of N2 by intact filaments. However, the kinetics of solubilization of the activity of glutamate synthase during cavitation of suspensions of A. cylindrica indicated that very little, if any, of the activity of that <span class="GENE">enzyme</span> was located in heterocysts. Concordantly, isolated heterocysts failed to form substantial amounts of radioactive glutamate from either [13N]glutamine or alph-[14C]ketoglutarate in the presence of other substrates and cofactors of the glutamate synthase reaction.

Peroxidation of endogenous lipid by liver microsomes, coupled with oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive materials, is markedly stimulated in the presence of indomethacin [1-(p-chlorobenzyl)-5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-indole acetic acid] (0.1--1.0 mM). Concurrently, indomethacin enhances the lipolysis of membrane phospholipid containing <span class="CHEMICAL">arachidonic acid</span> but has no effect on the rate of O2 uptake in these samples. The system generates a rapidly developed chemiliminescense (CL), the intensity and rate of development of which are related to indomethacin concentration. The microsomal CL generated in the presence of indomethacin is distinct from the previously reported CL in that the time required for maximum intensity development is a matter of seconds (20--180) rather than hours. The enhanced CL is believed to be due to an energy transfer reaction whereby a high energy species transfers energy to the indomethacin molecule, which, in turn, decays via chemiluminescense. An enhanced chemiluminescense was also observed when indomethacin was added to a <span class="GENE">lipoxidase</span> system and superoxide generating system (axanthine oxidase). Based on inhibitor studies, the rapidly developed chemiluminescense of the microsomal system requires cytochrome P-450 in addition to NADPH and coordinated iron ions.

<div class='SUBSTRATE'><table><tr><td>Phospholipase A2 as a probe of phospholipid distribution in erythrocyte membranes. Factors influencing the apparent specificity of the reaction. The action of snake venom phospholipases A2 in intact human erythrocytes was investigated in detail. The basis phospholipase from Agkistrodon halys blomhifii was found to induce both hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids and total <span class="GENE">cell</span> hemolysis under certain experimental conditions. The hydrolytic action of the basic enzyme was found to consist of two sequential events: (a) hydrolysis of 70% of the total <span class="GENE">cell</span> ph osphatidylcholine without any evident hemolysis; and (b) complete hydrolysis of the remaining <span class="CHEMICAL">phosphatidylcholine</span>, followed closely by extensive phosphatidylethanolamine hydrolysis and finally with onset of hemolysis, attack on the phosphatidylserine. At pH 7.4 and 10 mM Ca2+ only stage (a) occurred. However, a slight elevation of the pH of incubation to pH 8.0 and/or inclusion of 40 mM Ca2+ in the reaction mixture caused both events (a) and (b) to occur. The addition of glucose limited the action of the enzyme to stage (a) under any reaction conditions. An investigation showed that enzymically induced hemolysis occurred under conditions where the intracellular ATP levels were lowered. Data are presented which suggest that stage (b) is mediated by in influx of Ca2+ into the <span class="GENE">cell</span> when the levels of ATP are low. Interestingly the phosphllipase from Naja naja venom (Pakistan) yielded results similar to those observed with the basic enzyme from Agkistrodon venom. However, the enzyme from Crotalus adamanteus and the acidic enzyme also present in the Agkistrodon venom produced only slight hydrolysis or hemolysis under any of the conditions studied. Other species of erythrocytes, e.g., guinea pig, monkey, pig, and rat, were tested but only those from guinea pig behaved similarly to the human cells. Pig, monkey, and rat erythrocytes underwent very limited hydrolysis and hemolysis. It is evident that the use of these phospholipases to probe the localization of phospholipds in erythrocyte membranes must be approached with caution.

The level of cAMP in the tumour is 3 times lower than that in liver. By te kinetic parameters (Vmax, Km, pH optimum) adenylate cyclase from tumour does not show any significant differences as compared to the liver enzyme; the enzyme from hepatoma is, however, more sensitive to activation by F- ions. The activities of adenylate cyclase in liver and tumour cells are the same. Phosphodiesterases of cAMP from tumour and liver cells are similar in their Km values (3,3-10(-4) M for PDE1 and 2-10(-6) M for PDE2); however, the maximal and real rates of cAMP hydrolysis in hepatoma are much higher than in liver. The fact that both cAMP phosphodiesterase activities have similar dependence on Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations, suggests that PDE1 is a latent form of <span class="GENE">PDE2</span>. In tumour cells the equilibrium between these two forms is probably shifted towards the enzyme with high affinity for the substrate.

This enzyme preparation was characterized by a single band on the urea-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by a single precipitin line with its corresponding antiserum on double diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis. A 103-fold purification indicates that the oxidoreductase represents approximately 1% of the ghost protein mass. The specific activity of the purified enzyme was 112 units/mg protein. The pH optimum was 6.8 and the isoelectric point, pI, was 6.6 The oxidoreductase has a specificity for NADH as a cofactor. The NADPH was ineffective as a reducing agent. The enzyme activity was strongly temperature-dependent, displaying maximal activity between 35 and 40 degrees C. The energy of activation was 4.9 kcal. The enzyme activity was inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents, anionic detergents, and divalent ions. The amino acid composition of the purified enzyme is characterized by the presence of all common amino acids including half-cystine and tryptophan. The results of carbohydrate and lipid analyses indicated that the oxidoreductase is a glycolipoprotein with fucose, galactose, mannose, and <span class="CHEMICAL">glucosamine</span> as the sugar components and cholesterol and sphingomyelin as the lipid constituents.

The detection of more than one band positive for the NADH-nitroblue tetrazolium oxidoreductase reaction on electrophoresis of either the membranes of A. laidlawii or the cytoplasm of M mycoides subsp. capri also points in the same direction. The membrane-bound enzyme system differed, however, form the soluble one because it had a lower ratio of oxidase activity to oxidoreductase activity, and because it was less susceptible to heat inactivation and more readily incorporated incorporated into reaggregated membranes. In addition, the specific activity of the membrane-bound enzyme system increased as the culture aged, whereas that of the soluble system decreased as the culture aged. It is suggested that the different location in the cell could be responsible for some of the differences between the membrane-bound NADH oxidase activity of A. laidlawii and that found in the cytoplasm of M. mycoides subsp. capri.</td></tr></table></div>

A radiochemical method for the studies on the microsomal UDPglucuronic acid metabolism has been developed. 2. The rat liver microsomes caused a rapid hydrolysis of UDPglucuronic acid to D-glucuronic acid 1-phosphate and further although much slower to free D-glucuronic acid. In Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) they were produced in ratio 72 : 1. No other metabolites were found in measurable amounts. The pyrophosphatase splitting UDPglucuronic acid showed a pH optimum at 8.9, but the liberation of D-glucuronic acid from UDPglucuronic acid had two pH maxima (pH 3.5 and 8.5). EDTA appeared to be less powerful inhibitor of pyrophosphatase than previously suggested. About 25 per cent of the UDPglucuronic acid hydrolyzing activity was still remaining in the presence of 10 mM EDTA. D-Glucaro-1,4-lactone was found to have a slight inhibitory action on the pyrophosphatase activity. Citrate inhibited powerfully the hydrolysis of UDPglucuronic acid and the liberation of free D-glucuronic acid. Phosphate was also inhibitory. 3. In the presence of an exogenous UDPglucuronosyltransferase substrate, 4-nitrophenol, the formation of D-glucuronic acid 1-phosphate and free D-glucuronic acid were slightly reduced, and D-glucuronic acid 1-phosphate, 4-nitrophenylglucuronide and free D-glucuronic acid were produced in ratio 78 : 23 : 1. When 10 mM EDTA was added to diminish the hydrolytic consumption of the glucuronyl donor substrate, the corresponding ratio was still as unfavorable as 19 : 2.6 : 1. The measurable activity of UDPglucuronosyltransferase was lower in the presence of phosphate or citrate than in Tris-HCl buffer, although they protected the glucuronyl donor substrate against hydrolysis. 4. The results indicate that even in the presence of added <span class="CHEMICAL">glucuronyl acceptor</span> substrate the hydrolysis of UDPglucuronic acid predominates the conjugation in rat liver microsomes. The rate of the hydrolysis of UDPglucuronic acid is quite considerable even in the presence of EDTA, and it is recommended to control the UDPglucuronic acid pyrophosphatase activity when UDPglucuronosyltransferase and glucuronidation reactions are studied. Free D-glucuronic acid appears to be produced from UDPglucuronic acid for further use via D-glucuronic acid 1-phosphate, the rate-limiting step being the hydrolysis of this intermediate. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, glucuronides of either endogenous or exogenous aglycones and beta-glucuronidase have only a minor role in this respect in rat liver microsomes.</td></tr></table></div>

The enzyme oxydizes L(+)-lactate, the optimum activity of the enzyme being observed at pH 8.0. Oxydation of the substrate is followed by accumulation of H2O2. Silver ions, p-chloromercurybenzoate and dicumarol inhibit the activity of L(+)-lactatoxydase. Iron complexones, cyanide and L-malate do not inhibit oxydation of the substrate. Pyruvate and its fluorine derivative practically do not produce any inhibiting effects either. The enzyme preparation contains 0.6 moles of flavin and 2 moles of nonhaem iron per a mole of the enzyme. Km value for the substrate is equal to 4-10(-4) M, Vmax--4.5 mkatom O/min/mg. Acidation of incubation medium leads to a decrease both of Km and Vmax. Km value for oxygen is equal to 3.1 mkM O2.

<div class='SUBSTRATE'><table><tr><td>Studies on the oxidizing system in Holt's medium for histochemical demonstration of esterase activity. Esterase activity in guinea-pig thyroid and mouse epididymis epithelial cells has been studied using 5-bromoindoxyl acetate as substrate. The pattern of esterase activity in the thyroid of the guinea-pig is constant, irrespective of whether ferri-ferrocyanide (FFC) or certain <span class="CHEMICAL">copper</span> compounds are used as oxidizing agents in the incubation medium. The intensity of the coloured reaction product is increased when cobalt or manganese are added to the incubation medium. Activity is depressed by high concentrations of FFC when resent in incubation medium or preincubational buffer only. Epididymis cells contain an esterase activity which is not inhibited by conventional SH blocking agents, nor by high concentrations of FFC. From these results it appears that the mode of action of FFC in Holt's medium is as follows. At low concentrations FFC appears to act primarily as a catalytic agent in oxidation of indoxyl to indigoid. At high concentration FFC acts as an inhibitor of guinea-pig thyroid esterase, by oxidation of SH groups in the active centre. The <span class="GENE">esterase of mouse epididymis cell type eh 1</span> is not subject to this inhibition by FFC, presumably because it does not contain accessible SH groups in the active centre.</td></tr></table></div>

Under anaerobic conditions, cells of Entamoeba histolytica grown with bacteria produce H2 and acetate while cells grown axenically produce neither. Aerobically, acetate is produced and O2 is consumed by amebae from either type of cells. Centrifuged extracts, 2.4 x 106 x g x min, from both types of cells contain pyruvate synthase (EC 1.2.7.1) and an <span class="GENE">acetate thiokinase</span> which, together, form a system capable of converting pyruvate to acetate. Pyruvate synthase catalyzes the reaction: pyruvate + CoA leads to CO2 + acetyl-CoA + 2E.

The amebal <span class="GENE">acetate thiokinase</span> catalyzes the reaction acetyl-CoA + ADP + Pi leads to acetate + ATP + CoA. For this apparently new enzyme we suggest the trivial name acetyl-CoA-synthetase (ADP-forming). Extracts from axenic amebae do not contain hydrogenase, but extracts from cells grown with bacteria do. It is postulated that in bacteria-grown amebae electrons generated at the pyruvate synthase step are utilized anaerobically to produce H2 via the hydrogenase and that the acetyl-CoA is converted to acetate in an energy-conserving step catalyzed by amebal acetyl-CoA synthetase. Aerobically, cells grown under either regimen may utilize the energy-conserving pyruvate-to-acetate pathway since O2 then serves as the ultimate electron acceptor.</td></tr></table></div>

The partial purification of this new enzyme, designated troponin T kinase, involves precipitation of contaminating proteins at pH 6.1, fractionation of the supernatant with (NH4)2SO4 and successive column chromatographies on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxyapatite and Sepharose 6B.

Comparison of the activities of hexokinase, phosphorylase and phosphofructokinase in muscles from marine invertebrates indicates that they can be divided into three groups. First, the activities of the three enzymes are low in coelenterate muscles, catch muscles of molluscs and muscles of echinoderms; this indicates a low rate of <span class="CHEMICAL">carbohydrate</span> (and energy) utilization by these muscles. Secondly, high activities of phosphorylase and phosphofructokinase relative to those of hexokinase are found in, for example, lobster abdominal and scallop snap muscles; this indicates that these muscles depend largely on anaerobic degradation of glycogen for energy production. Thirdly, high activities of hexokinase are found in the radular muscles of prosobranch molluscs and the fin muscles of squids; this indicates a high capacity for glucose utilization, which is consistent with the high activities of enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in these muscles [Alp, Newsholme &amp; Zammit (1976) Biochem. J. 154, 689-700]. 2. The activities of <span class="GENE">lactate dehydrogenase</span>, octopine dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, cytosolic and mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase were measured in order to provide a qualitative indication of the importance of different processes for oxidation of glycolytically formed NADH. The muscles are divided into four groups: those that have a high activity of <span class="GENE">lactate dehydrogenase</span> relative to the activities of phosphofructokinase (e.g. crustacean muscles); those that have high activities of octopine dehydrogenase but low activities of <span class="GENE">lactate dehydrogenase</span> (e.g. scallop snap muscle); those that have moderate activities of both <span class="GENE">lactate dehydrogenase</span> and octopine dehydrogenase (radular muscles of prosobranchs), and those that have low activities of both <span class="GENE">lactate dehydrogenase</span> and octopine dehydrogenase, but which possess activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (oyster adductor muscles). It is suggested that, under anaerobic conditions, muscles of marine invertebrates form lactate and/or octopine or succinate (or similar end product) according to the activities of the enzymes present in the muscles (see above). The muscles investigated possess low activities of cytosolic glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which indicates that glycerol phosphate formation is quantitatively unimportant under anaerobic conditions, and low activities of mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, which indicates that the glycerol phosphate cycle is unimportant in the re-oxidation of glycolytically produced NADH in these muscles under aerobic conditions. Conversely, high activities of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase are present in some muscles, which indicates that the malate-aspartate cycle may be important in oxidation of glycolytically produced NADH under aerobic conditions. 3.

Chromatographic resolution and immunochemical differentiation from lipoprotein lipase. Hormone-sensitive lipase and cholesterol ester hydrolase of chicken adipose tissue were markedly activated by adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (on the average, 235 to 275%; occasionally as much as 1000%). Diglyceride and monoglyceride hydrolases were also activated, but to a lesser extent (60 to 87%). The activation of all four hydrolases was inhibited by protein kinase inhibitor and reversed by the addition of exogenous protein kinase. Following activation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, all four hydrolases were deactivated in a Mg2+-dependent reaction and then reactivated to or near initial levels on incubation with cAMP and Mg2+-ATP. The reversible deactivation is assumed to reflect activity of one or more protein phosphatases. The maximum activation obtainable for the four hydrolases decreased when the tissue had been previously exposed to <span class="GENE">glucagon</span>, indicating that the glucagon-induced activation was probably similar to or identical with the activation demonstrated in cell-free preparations. The pH optima for the four hydrolase activities were similar (7.13 to 7.38). Although the absolute activities and relative degrees of kinase activation differed according to the particular emulsified substrates used, the results do not rule out the possibility that all four hydrolase activities are referable to a single hormone-sensitive hydrolase. Hormone-sensitive <span class="CHEMICAL">acyl</span> hydrolases were separated from lipoprotein lipase by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Lipoprotein lipase was active against triolein, diolein, and monoolein, but not cholesterol oleate. Incubation of lipoprotein lipase with exogenous protein kinase, cAMP, and Mg2+ATP had no effect on any of the three hydrolase activities. Lipoprotein lipase was further purified to homogeneity and used to prepare antiserum in rabbits. The immunoglobin G fraction from these antisera completely inhibited lipoprotein lipase eluted from heparin-Sepharose columns. However, the hormone-sensitive hydrolase activities (not retained on heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography) were not inhibited by anti-lipoprotein lipase immunoglobin G, and anti-lopoprotein lipase immunoglobin G did not affect the activation process in crude fractions. Thus, hormone-sensitive lipase and lipoprotein lipase, functionally distinct enzymes, have been physically resolved and immunochemically distinguished. Apparently lipoprotein lipase activity is not regulated, at least directly, by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='SUBSTRATE'><table><tr><td>Status of blood group carbohydrate chains in ontogenesis and in oncogenesis. Blood group ABH determinants in human erythrocytes are carried by four kinds of glycolipid carbohydrate chains, differing in their structural complexity. They are Aa, Ab, Ac, and Ad for A variants, and H1, <span class="GENE">H2</span>, H3, and H4 for H variants (Table I and Fig 1). Based on the surface labeling of A variants and on the reactivity of erythrocytes to antibodies directed against H3 and against its degradation products, it is concluded that complex variants of A or H determinants (Ac and Ad/or H3 and H4) are absent or significantly low in fetal erythrocytes (80-150 days after gestation) and in new born erythrocytes, whereas these complex structures are fully developed in adult erythrocytes. In contrast, A determinants linked to simpler carbohydrate chains (Aa, Ab variants) are fully developed before birth and do not show significant change after birth. The precursor of blood group carbohydrate chains seems to be abundant in fetal or newborn erythrocytes. This assumption is based on the higher reactivity of fetal or newborn erythrocytes to an antibody, which is directed against the precursor N-acetylglucosaminly beta1 leads to 3 galactosyl beta1 leads to 4 glucosylceramide than in adult erythorocytes. Reactions of <span class="CHEMICAL">glycolipids</span> of gastrointestinal mucosa, with antibodies directed against H3 glycolipid and its degradation products, were compared to that of gastrointestinal tumors.

Thus, the enzyme has a high activity in extracts of pigmented cells and a low activity in extracts of non-pigmented cells. Further, oxygenation of a pigmented culture causes immediate cessation of pigment synthesis and produces a rapid fall in the activity of <span class="GENE">aminolaevulinate synthetase</span>. This loss of activity appears to be due to the loss of an endogenous activator of the enzyme. Thus, pigmented cells contain cystine trisulphide, which at muM concentrations is an activator of <span class="GENE">aminolaevulinate synthetase</span>, while oxygenation causes a rapid fall in the cellular content of this trisulphide. Cystathionase (EC 4.2.1.15) extracted from pigmented cells can catalyse the formation of cystine trisulphide from cystine, while rhodanese (EC 2.8.1.1) extracted from the same cells can catalyse the degradation of cystine trisulphide in the presence of sulphite to form cystine and thiosulphate. It is proposed that the cellular content of cystine trisulphide is controlled by changes in the levels of substrates for cystathionase and possibly rhodanese rather than changes in the amounts of these enzymes. Cystine trisulphide controls the activity of <span class="GENE">aminolaevulinate synthetase</span> by converting a low-activity form of the enzyme (b-form) into a high-activity form (a-form). The fall in <span class="GENE">aminolaevulinate synthetase</span> activity on oxygenation appears to be the result of cessation of conversion of b-form into a-form, along with a conversion of a-form into b-form.

<div class='SUBSTRATE'><table><tr><td>Mechanism by which neutral phosphate infusion elevates urine PCO2. Currently, the ability to elevate the urine PCO2 above that of the arterial blood is employed as an estimate of distal hydrogen ion secretion. Therefore, it is important to establish the mechanisms by which various factors affect the urine <span class="CHEMICAL">CO2</span> tension. This paper examines the physiologic process by which phosphate elevates the urine PCO2 in the dog. The rise in urine PCO2 due to phosphate could be the result of either (1) a distal mechanism, by affecting the delayed dehydration of carbonic acid, or (2) an increase in the medullary PCO2. The phosphate-induced elevation of urine PCO2 was abolished by <span class="GENE">carbonic anhydrase</span> infusion. This indicates that a distal mechanism is a major factor in the phosphate effect. Since acid phosphate infusion did not result in an elevated urine PCO2, it is unlikely that changes in the medullary PCO2 occur as a ry an increase in net acid excretion, indicating an increase in hydrogen ion secretion. The increased hydrogen ion secretion and rise in urine PCO2 were reproduced by infusion of the buffer, Tris-(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane, but not by sodium sulfate administration. These findings suggest that the phosphate-induced rise in urine PCO2 is due to the buffer properties of phosphate rather than to its nonreabsorable anion characteristics.</td></tr></table></div>

The enzyme was purified from lysozyme-lysate of the bacterial cells by salting out with <span class="CHEMICAL">ammonium sulfate</span>, adsorption on DEAE-cellulose, covalent chromatography on PCMB-Sepharose and by gel filtration on Sephadex G-150. By these procedures, the enzyme was purified about 800-fold with an activity recovery of 9%, and the preparation was electrophoretically homogenous. The enzyme was most active and stable at pH 7-8. The presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and EDTA was effective for stabilizing the enzyme. The molecular weight was estimated to be 72,000 by the gel filtration method and to be 24,000 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the enzyme is a subunit oligomer, presumably trimer. The enzyme was inactivated by the addition of PCMB, sodium tetrathionate, Hg2+ and Cu2+, but the activity lost was restored by the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol and EDTA. The purified enzyme split amide and ester linkages in L-pyroglutamyl derivatives of L-alanine, beta-naphthylamine, alpha-naphthol, and 4-methylumbelliferone, but was completely inert towards various peptides and esters used as substrates for usual amino- and carboxy-peptidases, and for endopeptidases such as <span class="GENE">trypsin</span>, subtilisin and alpha-chymotrypsin.</td></tr></table></div>

Paraffin sections of liver fixed with DMS at pH 9.5 were weakly stained with the ninhydrin-Schiff procedure, indicating extensive reaction of NH3+ groups with the fixative. Nuclei were strongly strained by the Feulgen procedure, with no background [corrected] reaction. In contrast, glutaraldehyde fixation resulted in a significant background reaction in the cytoplasm and nuclei in controls for the Schiff-based stains. DMS-fixed liver stained intensely for glycogen with the <span class="CHEMICAL">periodic acid</span>-Schiff procedure, and biochemical analysis of glycogen retention and extractability indicated that DMS retained considerably more glycogen in sections than glutaraldehyde. DMS-fixed liver incubated for thiamine pyrophosphatase activity revealed reaction product in ER cisternae, Goli saccules and bile canaliculi. Peroxisomes were strongly reactive for catalase activity after incubation in diaminobenzidine medium, and reaction product of glucose-6-phosphatase activity was considerably greater following DMS fixation than after glutaraldehyde. Biochemical studies revealed up to twice as musch residual activity of glucose-6-phosphatase after DMS fixation.

Biochemical assays on microdissected samples, denervation studies, subcellular fractionation, and light and electron microscopic autoradiography of high affinity uptake have been performed to study the cellular localization of transmitter candidates in the rat hippocampal formation. High affinity uptake of <span class="CHEMICAL">glutamate</span> and aspartate is localized in the terminals of several excitatory systems, such as the entorhino-dentate fibres (perforant path), mossy fibres (from granular cells) and pyramidal cell axons. Thus, in stratum radiatum and oriens of CA1, 85% of <span class="CHEMICAL">glutamate</span> and asparate uptake and 40% of <span class="CHEMICAL">glutamate</span> and aspartate content are lost after lesions of ipsilateral plus commissural fibres from CA3/CA4. Hippocampal efferents also take up aspartate and <span class="CHEMICAL">glutamate</span>, since these activities are heavily reduced in the lateral septum and mamillary bodies after transection of fimbria and the dorsal fornix. The synthesis (by glutamic acid decarboxylase), content and high affinity uptake of gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) are not reduced after lesions of these or other projection fibre systems. A localization in intrinsic neurons is confirmed by a selective loss of glutamic acid decarboxylase after local injections of kainic acid. Peak concentrations of the enzyme occur near the pyramidal and granular cell bodies, corresponding to the site of the inhibitory basket cell terminals, and in the outer parts of the molecular layers. Some 85% of glutamic acid decarboxylase is situated in 'nerve ending particles'. Acetylcholine synthesis (by <span class="GENE">choline acetyltransferase</span>) disappears after lesions of septo-hippocampal fibres. Since 80% of the hippocampal <span class="GENE">choline acetyltransferase</span> is in 'nerve ending particles', the characteristic topographical distribution of this enzyme should reflect the distribution of cholinergic septo-hippocampal afferents. Serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine and histamine are located/synthesized in afferent fibre systems. Some monoamine-containing afferents to the hippocampal formation pass via the septal area, others via the amygdala. The hippocampal formation also contains nerve elements reacting with antibodies against neuroactive peptides, such as enkephalin, substance P, somatostatin and gastrin/cholecystokinin.</td></tr></table></div>

The basis phospholipase from Agkistrodon halys blomhifii was found to induce both hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids and total <span class="GENE">cell</span> hemolysis under certain experimental conditions. The hydrolytic action of the basic enzyme was found to consist of two sequential events: (a) hydrolysis of 70% of the total <span class="GENE">cell</span> ph osphatidylcholine without any evident hemolysis; and (b) complete hydrolysis of the remaining phosphatidylcholine, followed closely by extensive phosphatidylethanolamine hydrolysis and finally with onset of hemolysis, attack on the <span class="CHEMICAL">phosphatidylserine</span>. At pH 7.4 and 10 mM Ca2+ only stage (a) occurred. However, a slight elevation of the pH of incubation to pH 8.0 and/or inclusion of 40 mM Ca2+ in the reaction mixture caused both events (a) and (b) to occur. The addition of glucose limited the action of the enzyme to stage (a) under any reaction conditions. An investigation showed that enzymically induced hemolysis occurred under conditions where the intracellular ATP levels were lowered. Data are presented which suggest that stage (b) is mediated by in influx of Ca2+ into the <span class="GENE">cell</span> when the levels of ATP are low. Interestingly the phosphllipase from Naja naja venom (Pakistan) yielded results similar to those observed with the basic enzyme from Agkistrodon venom. However, the enzyme from Crotalus adamanteus and the acidic enzyme also present in the Agkistrodon venom produced only slight hydrolysis or hemolysis under any of the conditions studied. Other species of erythrocytes, e.g., guinea pig, monkey, pig, and rat, were tested but only those from guinea pig behaved similarly to the human cells. Pig, monkey, and rat erythrocytes underwent very limited hydrolysis and hemolysis. It is evident that the use of these phospholipases to probe the localization of phospholipds in erythrocyte membranes must be approached with caution.

Accordingly, the total protonmotive force at this pH was very low, -51mV. Several lines of evidence indicate that the protonmotive force or delta psi did not directly energize TMG transport but, rather, that ATP was directly required: (a) in <span class="GENE">cells</span> treated with arsenate so that the delta psi was unaffected and cellular ATP levels were markedly lowered, TMG transport was inhibited in proportion to the reduction of cellular ATP, while electrogenic alpha-aminoisobutyric acid transport was not; (b) when a valinomycin-induced <span class="CHEMICAL">potassium</span> diffusion potential was established in starved <span class="GENE">cells</span>, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid transport, but not TMG transport, was stimulated; and (c) in a series of experiments in which the delta psi was rapidly abolished by treatment with gramicidin, ATP levels declined slowly and the rate of TMG transport correlated directly with ATP levels rather than with the delta psi.

The pH dependence for acylation of alpha-chymotrypsin by N-acetyltryptophan p-nitrophenyl-, p-nitrothiophenyl-, ethyl-, and thiolethyl esters has been studied by the stopped-flow technique. Values for the acylation rate constant, k2, and the binding constant, KS, were obtained by using measurements of <span class="CHEMICAL">phenolate</span> release, for the p-nitrophenyl esters, and proflavin displacement, for the ethyl esters. The oxygen esters tested have slightly higher k2 values, and substantially higher KS values relative to the analogous thiol esters. Whereas k2/KS for the thiolethyl ester is higher than that for the analogous oxygen ester, the k2/KS values for oxy- and thio-p-nitrophenyl esters are nearly identical. These data are interpreted to indicate rate-determining formation of a tetrahedral intermediate in acylation of alpha-chymotrypsin by p-nitrophenyl esters, and rate-determining breakdown of such an intermediate in the case of the ethyl esters. It is also concluded that the oxygen to sulfur substitution causes a substantial increase in the proportion of nonproductive binding in these substrates. pH dependent k2 and KS values were used to calculate values for k1 and k-1, the binding and debinding rate constants for the two p-nitrophenyl compounds.

Structural and immunochemical experiments with putidaredoxin, cytochrome P-450cam, and their 1:1 complex have led us to the following conclusions: Despite the remarkable sequence homology between putidaredoxin and adrenodoxin which permits a tentative assignment of cysteines binding to the (Fe-S)2 prosthetic group, these redox proteins cannot replace each other in reconstitution experiments because putidaredoxin contains a disulfide loop close to its P-450cam binding site. This feature may also be responsible for the complete lack of immunochemical cross reactivity between these proteins. The stability of putidaredoxin can be enhanced significantly by cross linkage with glutaraldehyde without change in spectral, catalytic, or immunochemical properties, Putidaredoxin also gains stability by binding to the P-450-camphor complex in a 1:1 ratio. Precipitation of this complex with anti-P-450cam antibodies gives access to site specific antibodies directed against the putidaredoxin binding site of P-450cam. A series of putidaredoxin-cytochrome P-450cam-substrate complexes with ratios of 1 to 6 molecules of redoxin per molecule of cytochrome have been obtained by migration of excess redoxin across prefocused P-450cam in electrofocusing. Complete inhibition of camphor hydroxylation was achieved by anti-P-450cam antibodies, their Fab fragments, anti-putidaredoxin-trimer antibodies, and antibodies directed against the putidaredoxin-P-450cam complex. Five major antigenic sites were tentatively established for P-450cam, two of which seem to be associated with the BrCN hemepeptide while one each relates to the putidaredoxin binding site, the Trp-Arg site close to the C-terminus, and the site surrounding the most reactive SH group which gives rise to dimer formation. Iodination, of P-450cam at tyrosyl residues only permitted use of a sensitive radioimmunoassay procedure for testing of cross reacting material (CRM) remaining after degradation of P-450cam with BrCN and <span class="GENE">enzymes</span>, denaturation with acetone, and complex formation with the redoxin. The BrCN hemepeptide still has a Soret maximum at 390 nm and reacts with CO yielding a P-420 spectrum. All 6 half-cystines of P-450cam are present as free sulfhydryls and can be titrated after denaturation but only 4 of them are available in the P-450-camphor complex. Three of these are close to each other and the <span class="CHEMICAL">heme</span>, and work in concert; their alkylation with N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) leads to shifts of the Soret from 391 to 417 nm and concomitant changes in redox potential, EPR-signals and DPNH-reactivity. The fifth SH group is protected by camphor while the 6th SH group, still present in the BrCN heme-peptide, is implicated in chelation to the <span class="CHEMICAL">heme</span> iron by a drastic change in EPR spectra, reflecting pure axial symmetry at the <span class="CHEMICAL">heme</span> after complete alkylation by NEM.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='SUBSTRATE'><table><tr><td>A coupled enzymatic method to measure blood lactate by amperometric monitoring of the rate of oxygen depletion with a Clark oxygen electrode. A rapid, sensitive and reliable method to measure lactate in blood is described. The method is based on the enzymatic oxidation of lactate to pyruvate in the presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The reaction product, NADH, is then oxidized by molecular oxygen, carried in the buffered reagent medium, in the presence of <span class="GENE">horeseradish peroxidase</span> and other cofactors. The maximum rate of oxygen depletion, which is directly proportional to the amount of <span class="CHEMICAL">lactate ion</span> present in the sample, is amperometrically monitored by a membrane oxygen electrode.

Approximately 0.5 g of metabolite of each piperazine-substituted phenothiazine drug was prepared in reactors containing, as catalyst, the purified oxidase covalently attached to glass beads.

In the two former organisms the activity of 14CO2 derived from L-proline-14C was as high or higher than that derived from D-glucose-14C; in L. donovani more 14CO2 is derived from D-glucose-14C than from L-proline-14C.

Systematic analysis of the hydrolysis of benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)-dipeptides by cathepsin A [EC 3.4.12.1] purified from rat liver lysosomes showed that multiple forms of cathepsin A preferentially cleave peptide bonds with leucine, methionine, and phenylalanine. Cbz-Met-Met, -Met-Phe, -Phe-Met, and -Phe-Ala were hydrolyzed 6 to 8 times faster than the standard substrates, Cbz-Glu-Phe and Cbz-Glu-Tyr. The pH optima of the hydrolyses were 4.6 to 5.8. Hydrolysis of peptide bonds with glycine, isoleucine, and <span class="CHEMICAL">proline</span> was very slow, but the rate depended on the nature of the adjacent amino acids. Proteins such as albumin, cytochrome c, gamma-globulin, hemoglobin, histone, myoglobin, and myosin were scarecely degraded. Peptide hormones, such as glucagon and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were hydrolyzed markedly with optimum pH's of 4.5 and 4.6, respectively. Angiotensin I, II, bradykinin, Lys- and Met-Lysbradykinin (kallidin and Met-kallidin), and substance P were also hydrolyzed at appreciable rates. pH optima for these peptide hormones were 5.2 to 5.6. On the other hand, insulin and its A chain, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH), oxytocin and vasopressin were cleaved slowly. In the hydrolyses of glucagon and other peptides, multiple forms of rat liver lysosomal cathepsin A again showed a carboxypeptidase nature, cleaving peptide bonds sequentially from the carboxyl terminal. Almost all of the amino acids were cleaved on prolonged incubation. Vaso-activites of angiotensin II and bradykinin were rapidly lost on hydrolysis by cathepsin A. Lysosomal cathepsin C [dipeptidylaminopeptidase I, EC 3.4.14.1] also activated angiotensin II, but did not inactive bradykinin. Cathepsin A, therefore, can be regarded as one of the lysosomal angiotensinases and <span class="GENE">kinases</span>.

<div class='SUBSTRATE'><table><tr><td>Mechanism by which neutral phosphate infusion elevates urine PCO2. Currently, the ability to elevate the urine PCO2 above that of the arterial blood is employed as an estimate of distal hydrogen ion secretion. Therefore, it is important to establish the mechanisms by which various factors affect the urine CO2 tension. This paper examines the physiologic process by which phosphate elevates the urine PCO2 in the dog. The rise in urine PCO2 due to phosphate could be the result of either (1) a distal mechanism, by affecting the delayed dehydration of carbonic <span class="CHEMICAL">acid</span>, or (2) an increase in the medullary PCO2. The phosphate-induced elevation of urine PCO2 was abolished by <span class="GENE">carbonic anhydrase</span> infusion. This indicates that a distal mechanism is a major factor in the phosphate effect. Since <span class="CHEMICAL">acid</span> phosphate infusion did not result in an elevated urine PCO2, it is unlikely that changes in the medullary PCO2 occur as a ry an increase in net <span class="CHEMICAL">acid</span> excretion, indicating an increase in hydrogen ion secretion. The increased hydrogen ion secretion and rise in urine PCO2 were reproduced by infusion of the buffer, Tris-(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane, but not by sodium sulfate administration. These findings suggest that the phosphate-induced rise in urine PCO2 is due to the buffer properties of phosphate rather than to its nonreabsorable anion characteristics.</td></tr></table></div>

The hydrolysis of the <span class="CHEMICAL">phospholipids</span> of intact human serum high density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3) by pure alpha-phospholipase A2 from Crotalus adamanteus was studied by pH-stat titration. The enzyme quantitatively hydrolyzed phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine and left sphinogomyelin intact, yielding a stable and water-soluble modified HDL. Lysophospholipids and free fatty acids, the products of hydrolysis, remained in the lipoprotein. When 1 mol of defatted bovine serum albumin/mol of substrate <span class="CHEMICAL">phospholipids</span> was added to the reaction mixture, up to 60% of the fatty acids and 85% of the lysophospholipids were removed from the modified lipoprotein. The immunological reactivity of the hydrolyzed HDL remained unaltered in both the presence and absence of albumin. The changes in the physical properties of the lipoprotein during hydrolysis were rather small, the most notable being an increase in the hydrated density and in the electrophoretic mobility in alkaline buffers. The hydrolysis followed an apparent first order time course with product inhibition (KI) and yielded values of kcat/Km = 7 X 10(5 M(-1)s(-1) and KI congruent to 1 X 10(-4) M. Addition of albumin to the reaction mixture relieved the product inhibition without any alteration of the kinetic parameters. High concentrations of albumin protected some of the substrate <span class="CHEMICAL">phospholipids</span> from hydrolysis, presumably through complexation to the lipoprotein. The Arrhenius plot for the experimental first order rate constant in the absence of albumin (kexp = kcat (KI/Km)) was linear between 15 degrees and 47 degrees, indicating the absence of any phospholipid phase transitions and yielding an activation energy of 15.2 kcal/mol. From the accessibility of the HDL <span class="CHEMICAL">phospholipids</span> to phospholipase A2 one concludes that the phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine are located at, or are in rapid equilibrium with, the surface of this lipoprotein. It also appears that these <span class="CHEMICAL">phospholipids</span> are not essential for maintaining the supramolecular properties of the lipoprotein in vitro.

The initial change in the glycolytic sequence occurred at 2.5 min with decreases in tissue glucose and glucose-6-phosphate and increases in fructose-1-6-diphosphate which indicated an activation of phosphofructokinase and hexokinase. The "crossover" pattern between glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-1,6-diphosphate was present at 5, 7.5 and 10 min, but not at 20, 30 and 60 min and thus confirmed previous observations that detection of phosphofructokinase activation in acute unifactorial cerebral hypoxia requires tissue study during the early phases of the experimental exposure. The initial activation of phosphofructokinase occurred in the absence of detectable changes in the tissue content of <span class="CHEMICAL">ATP</span>, ADP, AMP or phosphocreatine and therefore suggested that an imbalance of tissue energy homeostasis is not a prerequisite for the activation of glycolysis in CO intoxication. One percent CO resulted in an increasing malate/oxaloacetate ratio at 5 min, followed by a decrease in alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate at 7.5 min which suggested a shift in the <span class="GENE">aspartate aminotransferase</span> reaction towards the replenishment of oxaloacetate removed via the malate dehydrogenase reaction. Subsequent increases in alpha-ketoglutarate at 10, 20, 30 and 60 min were associated with increases in alanine, indicating a contributing role for a secondary shift of the alanine aminotransferase reaction in the replenishment of alpha-ketoglutarate.

Half-maximum activation of the phosphoprotein formation and ATP-ADP phosphate exchange is reached at an ionized calcium concentration of about 0.3 muM. The Hill coefficients are 1.3. 3.

Phosphoprotein formation and ATP-ADP phosphate exchange are not affected by azide, dinitrophenol, dicyclohexyl carbodiimide and oubain, whilst both activities are reduced by blockade of -SH groups localized on the outside of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. 6. The isolated phosphoprotein is acid stable. The trichloroacetic acid denatured 32P-labelled membrane complex is dephosphorylated by hydroxylamine, which might indicate that the phosphorylated protein is an acyl-phosphate. 7.

Optimal activities for p-nitrophenyl phosphate, ATP and inorganic pyrophosphate are found at pH 10.5, 10.0 and 8.5, respectively. The latter two substrates exhibit substrate inhibition at high concentrations. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate demonstrates decreasing pH optima with decreasng substrate concentration. Heat inactivation studies indicate that both phosphorolytic and pyrophosphorolytic cleavage occur at the same site on the enzyme. Mg2+ (0.1-10.0 mM) and Mn2+ (0.01-0.1 mM) show a small stimulation of p-nitrophenyl phosphate-splitting activity at pH 10.5. Levamisole, Pi, CN-, Zn2+ and L-phenylalanine are all reversible inhibitors of the <span class="GENE">phosphomonoesterase</span> activity. Pi is a competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 10.0 mM. Levamisole and Zn2+ are potent non-competitive inhibitors with inhibition constants of 0.05 and 0.04 mM, respectively. The chondrocytic alkaline phosphatase is inhibited irreversibly by Be2+, EDTA, EGTA, ethane-1-hydroxydiphosphonate, dichloromethane diphosphonate, L-cysteine, phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride, N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide. NaCL, KCL and Na2SO4 at 0.5-1.0 M inhibit the enzyme.

Most of the activity appeared to be on cell surfaces as supernatant media had less than 20% of the Tos-Arg-OMe esterase activity on the cell suspensions. Cell surface Tos-Arg-OMe esterase activity was inhibited by aprotinin, benzamidine, pentamidine, and a tris-amidine derivative (alpha,alpha',alpha''-tris(3-amidinophenoxy)mesitylene). Preincubation of cells with phospholipase A2 increased renal cell surface esterase activity up to 76% while only slightly increasing supernatant activity.

The damping factor is comparable to that observed in the O2 flash yield oscillation and therefore explained by misses in Photosystem II. (2) On the average and after a steady state is reached, each flash (i.e. each reduction of Q) induces the uptake of 2H+ from outside the chloroplasts. (3) Flash induced proton release inside the chloroplast membrane shows a strong damped binary oscillation with maximum release occurring also after the 2nd, 4th, etc. flashes.

Because of the instability of acetyl-S-citrate lyase at acidic and alkaline pH values, all assays were carried out at pH 7.2, where the spontaneous hydrolysis of the acetyl-S-citrate lyase was negligible and deacetylase showed 70% of the activity at pH 8.1. The apparent Km value for <span class="CHEMICAL">citrate</span> lyase was 10(-7) M at pH 7.2 and 30 C. The activity of the deacetylase was restricted to the <span class="CHEMICAL">citrate</span> lyase from R. gelatinosa.

The ability of 5-deazaisoalloxazines to substitute for the isoalloxazine (flavin) coenzyme has been examined with several flavoenzymes. Without exception, the deazaflavin is recognized at the active site and undergoes a redox change in the presence of the specific enzyme substrate. Thus, deazariboflavin is reduced catalytically by NADH in the presence of the Beneckea harveyi NAD(P)H:(flavin) oxidoreductase, the reaction proceeding to an equilibrium with an equilibrium constant near unity. This implies an E0 of -0.310 V for the deazariboflavindihydrodeazariboflavin couple, much lower than that for isoalloxazines. With this enzyme, both riboflavin and deazariboflavin show the same stereospecificity with respect to the pyridine nucleotide, and despite a large difference in Vmax for the two, both have the same rate-determining step (hydrogen transfer). Direct transfer of the hydrogen is seen between the nicotinamide and deazariboflavin in both reaction directions. DeazaFMN reconstituted yeast NADPH: (acceptor) oxidoreductase (<span class="GENE">old yellow enzyme</span>), and deazaFAD reconstituted D-amino acid:O2 oxidoreductase and Aspergillus niger D-glucose O2 oxidoreductase are all reduced by substrate at approximately 10(-5) the rate of holoenzyme; none are reoxidized by <span class="CHEMICAL">oxygen</span> or any of the tested artificial electron acceptors, though deazaFADH-bound to D-amino acid:O2 oxidoreductase is rapidly oxidized by the imino acid product. Direct hydrogen transfer from substrate to deazaflavin has been demonstrated for both deazaFAD-reconstituted oxidases. These data implicate deazaflavins as a unique probe of flavin catalysis, in that any mechanism for the flavin catalysis must account for the deazaflavin reactivity as well.</td></tr></table></div>

This reagent has an imidoester at one end, which reacts spontaneously with primary amines, and an <span class="CHEMICAL">arylazide</span> at the other end, which reacts with a variety of chemical groups upon photolysis by ultraviolet radiation. The reagent molecules were attached to <span class="GENE">concanavalin a</span> by reactions between imidoester groups of the reagents and free amino groups of the lectin. These activated lectins were purified on a Sephadex G-25 column and showed the binding affinity to an affinity column, glucosylated Sepharose, and to the human erythrocyte ghost membrane. The activated lectins were incubated with the membranes and then unbound lectins were removed by washing. The lectins bound to receptors in the membranes were irradiated with a shortwave ultraviolet lamp to photolyze arylazides attached to the lectins, thus cross-linking the lectins and receptors together. Then the membranes were solubilized and electrophoresed. On gels, the intensity of the lectin receptor band diminished slightly and concomitantly a new band of a higher molecular weight appeared. When 125I-labeled <span class="GENE">concanavalin a</span> was used, the new band contained the radioactivity. The extent of the appearance of the new band and the decrease of the receptor band were reduced significantly when the ultraviolet irradiation was omitted or the activated lectins were incubated with the membranes in the presence of the lectin inhibitor, alpha-methylmannoside. The irradiation of nonactivated, receptor-bound <span class="GENE">concanavalin a</span> did not cause those changes. When the activated lectins alone were irradiated with ultraviolet, the band of the lectin dimer appeared whereas nonirradiated lectins appeared mostly as monomers. It is concluded that a small fraction of the activated lectins were cross-linked to receptors in the membrane upon photolysis. In this study, only 8 reagent molecules were attached to a tetramer of the lectin, compared with the presence of approximately 40 available free amino groups. The efficiency of such cross-links of ligands to receptors may be increased by employing longer versions of the hetero-bifunctional cross-linking reagents and also by attaching more of the reagent molecule to ligands.</td></tr></table></div>

Cyclohexanol-grown cells oxidize the growth substrate at a rate of 230 mul of O2/h per mg dry wt with the consumption of 5.65 mumol of O2/mumol substrate.

The greater accumulation from partially ionized solution was not attributable solely to metabolism of succinic acid nor to the lower external concentration of potassium ion. Rate of uptake by sodium azide and iodoacetate-treated mycelium was proportional to external concentration at least up to 200 mumol/ml. External potassium or sodium ion was not required for uptake by inhibited or uninhibited mycelium and external sodium ion and glucose did not allow concentration of succinic acid. The internal concentrations of <span class="CHEMICAL">succinic acid carbon</span> expressed as succinic acid in cell water were about the same as the external concentrations.

The ATP-linked reaction was partially inhibited in French press extracts of E. coli K-12 C600 cells that had been pretreated with colicin K but not in extracts from similarly treated cells of a colicin-tolerant mutant. Ultracentrifugation of extracts yielded particulate fractions competent in catalyzing the reaction; this reaction is substantially inhibited in fractions from colicin-treated cells. The extent of inhibition increased with increasing concentration of colicin. Supernatants also supported ATP-linked formation of NADPH, but this reaction was insensitive to the colicin effect. A comparison between the requirement of the reaction in supernatant and particulate fractions suggests that the reaction in the supernatant is different from the one inhibited by colicin. The ATP-hydrolyzing ability of particulate fractions from the control or treated bacteria was identical. Likewise, the electron transport chain was not affected by colicin treatment, as evidenced from lack of effect on NADH oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and NADPH-NAD transhydrogenase.

These observations indicate that opossum <span class="GENE">hemoglobin</span> may have a destabilized <span class="CHEMICAL">oxy</span> structure when compared to <span class="GENE">hemoglobin</span> A due to differences in primary structure. Thus, the strong trans ligand effect of nitric oxide is able to disrupt the proximal histidine-iron bond in the alpha-hemes triggering a conformational transition to the T state. Absence of a distal histidine in the alpha-subunits and, therefore an impaired donor acceptor interaction with the sixth ligand, could contribute to the lack of stability of the R quaternary structure in opossum nitrosylhemoglobin.

The COOH-terminal tryptic peptide of of the protease molecule contains some 43 residues, most of which are aspartic acids, asparagines, and prolines. The amino acid sequence of this peptide was not determined. The primary structure near the active serine residue indicates that staphylococcal protease is related to the pancreatic serine proteases. However, it has little or no additional sequence homologies with these enzymes except for the regions near histidine-50 and aspartic acid - 91.

The dimerization constant for L(RA) was 4 X 10(4) M-1 at at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C, which was smaller than that for VL (1 X 10(5) M-1). The ellipticity at 278 nm for the L(RA) dimer was different from that for the L(SS) dimer and changed with pH.

The histochemistry of polysaccharides and proteins and the distribution of RNA were investigated in the glands and mature secretion of the anal sacs of the cat. Glycogen was extremely abundant in the epithelial lining of the lumen and efferent duct of the anal sac and also in ducts of sebaceous glands of the sacs constantly formed in the place of degenerating acini. Little glycogen was found in the unchanged sebaceous acini. The apocrine glands of the anal sacs were substantially richer in glycogen than the apocrine sweat glands of the skin and were in an active state. A high concentration of acid mucopolysaccharides was present in the mature secretion, and their source was the apocrine glands.

Neutral and acid mucopolysaccharides were present in the mature secretion in the form of complexes with one another in approximately equal proportions; neutral polysaccharides consisted chiefly of glycogen. Besides polysaccharides, the apocrine glands produce large quantities of protein, in which the mature secretion was rich.

Photodestruction of the coenzyme was about 16%. The rate of enzyme photoinactivation is constant in the pH range 6--8, and drastically decreases with lowering pH from 6 to 4. alpha-Ketoglutarate partially protects the holoenzyme from inactivation. The <span class="GENE">apoenzyme</span> undergoes photoinactivation at a rate almost twice as rapid as the holoenzyme. Photooxidized apotransaminase retains affinity to pyridoxal phosphate and binds as much coenzyme as the native <span class="GENE">apoenzyme</span>. Photooxidation induces no significant alterations in the circular dichroism pattern of the enzyme in the 200 to 240 nm range. However, positive circular dichroism is markedly increased in the absorption bands of aromatic amino acids (260--300 nm). The affinity of photooxidized holoenzyme for glutarate and alpha-methyl aspartate is greatly decreased. On the other hand, photooxidized enzyme retains its ability to bind alpha-alanine and to catalize the transamination half-reaction between alpha-alanine and the bound coenzyme. These findings imply that photooxidation disturbs the binding of the distal carboxyl group of dicarboxylic substrates. This may be due to a localized conformational change induced by destruction of a photoreactive histidine residue at the active site. A role of the histidine residue in transamination reaction is discussed.</td></tr></table></div>

Degradation of myelin basic protein during incubations with high concentrations of horseradish peroxidase has been demonstrated [Johnson &amp; Cammer (1977) J. Histochem. Cytochem.25, 329-336]. Possible mechanisms for the interaction of the basic protein with peroxidase were investigated in the present study. Because the peroxidase samples previously observed to degrade basic protein were mixtures of isoenzymes, commercial preparations of the separated isoenzymes were tested, and all three degraded basic protein, but to various extents. Three other basic proteins, P(2) protein from peripheral nerve myelin, <span class="GENE">lysozyme</span> and cytochrome c, were not degraded by horseradish peroxidase under the same conditions. Inhibitor studies suggested a minor peroxidatic component in the reaction. Therefore the peroxidatic reaction with basic protein was studied by using low concentrations of peroxidase along with H(2)O(2). Horseradish peroxidase plus H(2)O(2) caused the destruction of basic protein, a reaction inhibited by cyanide, azide, ferrocyanide, <span class="CHEMICAL">tyrosine</span>, di-iodotyrosine and catalase. Lactoperoxidase plus H(2)O(2) and myoglobin plus H(2)O(2) were also effective in destroying the myelin basic protein. Low concentrations of horseradish peroxidase plus H(2)O(2) were not active against other basic proteins, but did destroy casein and fibrinogen. Although high concentrations of peroxidase alone degraded basic protein to low-molecular-weight products, suggesting the operation of a proteolytic enzyme contaminant in the absence of H(2)O(2), incubations with catalytic concentrations of peroxidase in the presence of H(2)O(2) converted basic protein into products with high molecular weights. Our data suggest a mechanism for the latter, peroxidatic, reaction where polymers would form by linking the <span class="CHEMICAL">tyrosine</span> side chains in basic-protein molecules. These data show that the myelin basic protein is unusually susceptible to peroxidatic reactions.</td></tr></table></div>

The unfractionated product of the reaction of N alpha-acetyl-L-histidine with bromoacetate yields four resonances of nonprotonated aromatic carbons. These resonances are assigned (on a one-to-one basis) to C gamma of the intact amino acid, the two monocarboxymethylated derivatives (at N delta1 and N epsilon2), and the dicarboxymethylated derivative. The effect of pH on the chemical shift of C gamma is characteristic for each of the four species. This property is used to study the carboxymethylation of His-15 of hen egg white lysozyme upon treatment with iodoacetate. With the use of various reaction conditions, His 15 is carboxymethylated in detectable quantities only at N epsilon2. The spectra of the various reaction mixtures indicate which conditions are best for maximizing the yield of this derivative. A comparison of the spectrum of chromatographically pure [N epsilon2-carboxymethylhistidine-15]lysozyme with that of the intact <span class="GENE">protein</span> indicates that the chemical modification does not significantly affect the conformation of the <span class="GENE">protein</span> (at least in the regions of all aromatic amino acid residues).</td></tr></table></div>

The final yield of the purified R protein was approximately 15 mug (dry weight) per g (wet weight) of washed and sedimented streptococci. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated a molecular size of approximately 78,000 daltons. Amino acid analysis showed lysine, glutamic acid, <span class="CHEMICAL">alanine</span>, and aspartic acid as the predominant amino acids. A detailed comparison of the purified R3 protein with type 3 <span class="GENE">M</span> protein indicated a similarity in composition and order of frequency of amino acids. However, the R3 antigen was found to be distinctive from the M3 antigen in agar gel diffusion tests. In addition, R3 and M3 proteins behaved differently in opsonophagocytosis tests and opsonization inhibition tests. Thus, R3 and M3 proteins produced precipitin lines of nonidentity with an unabsorbed antiserum against whole type 3 streptococci: M3-specific antiserum, but not R3-specific antiserum, enhanced the phagocytosis of type 3 streptococci.

The protein remains in the low spin configuration which implies the retention of two strong field ligands. Spin state sensitive spectral titrations and model studies of heme peptides indicate that the sixth ligand is definitely not provided by a lysine residue but may be methionine-80 sulfoxide coordinated via its sulfur atom. Circular dichroism spectra indicate that the heme crevice of methionine sulfoxide ferri- and <span class="GENE">ferrocytochrome c</span> is weakened relative to native cytochrome c.

The terminal <span class="CHEMICAL">phosphate</span> of (gamma-32P)ATP is rapidly incorporated into cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes (0.7--1.3 mumol/g protein) in the presence of calcium and magnesium. Cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes catalize an ATP-ADP <span class="CHEMICAL">phosphate</span> exchange in the presence of calcium and magnesium. 2. Half-maximum activation of the phosphoprotein formation and ATP-ADP <span class="CHEMICAL">phosphate</span> exchange is reached at an ionized calcium concentration of about 0.3 muM. The Hill coefficients are 1.3. 3. Transphosphorylation and ATP-ADP <span class="CHEMICAL">phosphate</span> exchange require magnesium and are maximally activated at magnesium concentrations close to or equal to the ATP concentration. 4. The phosphoprotein level is reduced to about 45% at an ADP/ATP ratio of 0.1. The rate of calcium-dependent ATP splitting declines, whilst the rate of the calcium-dependent ATP-ADP <span class="CHEMICAL">phosphate</span> exchange increases when the ADP/ATP ratio is varied from 0.1 to 1. The sum of both, the rate of ATP splitting and the rate of ADP-ATP <span class="CHEMICAL">phosphate</span> exchange remains constant. 5. Phosphoprotein formation and ATP-ADP <span class="CHEMICAL">phosphate</span> exchange are not affected by azide, dinitrophenol, dicyclohexyl carbodiimide and oubain, whilst both activities are reduced by blockade of -SH groups localized on the outside of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. 6. The isolated phosphoprotein is acid stable. The trichloroacetic acid denatured 32P-labelled membrane complex is dephosphorylated by hydroxylamine, which might indicate that the phosphorylated protein is an acyl-phosphate. 7. Polyacrylamide gel elctrophoresis (performed with phenol/acetic acid/water) of phosphorylated sarcoplasmic reticulum fractions demonstrates that the 32P-incorporation occurs into a protein of about 100000 molecular weight. 8. It is suggested that the phosphoprotein represents a phosphorylated intermediate of the calcium-dependent ATPase which formation occurs as an early step in the reaction sequence of calcium translocation by cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum similar as in skeletal muscle.</td></tr></table></div>

Proton magnetic resonance pH titration studies of the two <span class="CHEMICAL">histidines</span> of <span class="GENE">bovine chymotrypsinogen a</span> and chymotrypsin Aalpha. Reversible unfolding of <span class="GENE">bovine chymotrypsinogen a</span> in 2H2O either by heating at low pH or by exposure to 6 M guanidinium chloride results in the exchange of virtually all the nitrogen-bound hydrogens that give rise to low-field 1H NMR peaks, without significant exchange of the histidyl ring Cepsilon1 hydrogens. These preexchange procedures have enabled the resolution of two peaks, using 250-MHz correlation 1H NMR spectroscopy, that are attributed to the two histidyl residues of chymotrypsinogen A. Assignments of the Cepsilon1 hydrogen peaks to histidine-40 and -57 were based on comparison of the NMR titration curves of the native zymogen with those of the diisopropylphosphoryl derivative. Two histidyl Cepsilon1 H peaks were also resolved with solutions of preexchanged chymotrypsin Aalpha. The histidyl peaks of chymotrypsin Aalpha were assigned by comparison of NMR titration curves of the free enzyme with those of its complex with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz). The NMR titration curves of histidine-57 in the zymogen and enzyme and histidine-40 in the zymogen exhibit two inflections; the additional inflections were assigned to interactions with neighboring carboxyl groups: aspartate-102 in the case of histidine-57 and aspartate-194 in the case of histidine-40 of the zymogen. In <span class="GENE">bovine chymotrypsinogen a</span> in 2H2O at 31 degrees C, histidine-57 has a pK' of 7.3 and aspartate-102 a pK' of 1.4, and the histidine-40-aspartate-194 system exhibits inflections at pH 4.6 and 2.3. In bovine chymotrypsin Aalpha under the same conditions, the histidine-57-aspartate-102 system has pK' values of 6.1 and 2.8, and histidine-40 has a pK' of 7.2. The results suggest that the pK' of histidine-57 is higher than the pK' of aspartate-102 in both zymogen and enzyme. A significant difference exists in the structure and properties of the catalytic center between the zymogen and activated enzyme. In addition to the difference in pK' values, the chemical shift of histidine-57, which is highly abnormal in the zymogen (deshielded by 0.6 ppm), becomes normalized upon activation. These changes may explain part of the increase in the catalytic activity upon activation. The 1H NMR chemical shift of the Cepsilon1 H of histidine-57 in the chymotrypsin Aalpha-pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz) complex is constant between pH 3 and 9 at a value similar to that of histidine-57 in the porcine trypsin-pancreatic trypsin inhibitor complex [Markley, J.L., and Porubcan, M. A. (1976), J. Mol. Biol. 102, 487--509], suggesting that the mechanisms of interaction are similar in the two complexes.</td></tr></table></div>

It can be solubilized qualitatively by treatment with <span class="GENE">papain</span> or Triton X-100. Neither procedure affects its catalytic activity but the two resulting forms of the enzyme differ considerably in their physical properties. The papain-solubilized transpeptidase is soluble in aqueous buffers and was purified 430-fold. It has an s20,w of 4.9 S, a Stokes radius of 36 A, and a calculated molecular weight of 69,000. It appears homogeneous by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation (Mr=66,700). In contrast, the Triton-solubilized transpeptidase is soluble only in the presence of detergents and was purifed 300-fold. This form of the enzyme has a Stokes radius of 70 A but an s20,w of only 4.15 S. Aggregation of the enzyme just below the critical micelle concentration of Triton X-100 and its ability to bind 1.16 mg of Triton X-100-protein complex was calculated to be 169,000, but the glycoprotein portion of the complex is 52% of the total mass (87,000). The mass of Triton X-100 (82,000) is consistent with its reported micelle molecular weight. Treatment of the Triton-purified transpeptidase with <span class="GENE">papain</span> or bromelain results in a form of the enzyme identical in all respects with the papain-purified enzyme. Both the Triton- and papain-purified transpeptidase exhibit two protein bands on <span class="CHEMICAL">sodium lauryl sulfate</span>-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The smaller subunits of the two forms appear identical (Mr=27,000), while the larger subunits of the Triton- and papain-purified enzyme have apparent molecular weights of 54,000 and 51,000, respectively. These data suggest that a peptide (3,000 to 19,000) in the larger subunit of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase is responsible for its binding to Triton micelles and probably for holding the enzyme in the brush border membrane.</td></tr></table></div>

These results suggest that the human enzyme has <span class="CHEMICAL">amino</span> groups at the active sites, as was shown previously for the horse enzyme. The variant subunit occuring in the enzyme isolated from atypical human livers does not seem to be activated by acetimidylation, which may indicate that substitution of proline for Ala-230 or modifiction of Lys-228 is sufficient to fully activate the enzyme. Results of product inhibition studies of native and modified human enzymes are consistent with an Ordered Bi Bi mechanism. However, the major isoenzyme of native human liver alcohol, dehydrogenase exhibits nonlinear kinetics over a wide range of ethanol concentrations. This result may indicate that subunits with different kinetic characteristics are present or that there is negative cooperativity between subunits.

A novel component of the properdin system has been discribed which represents a heretofore unrecognized human serum protein. The protein has been tentatively termed the initiating factor (IF) because it functions in the initial reaction of the properdin pathway. IF is a 170,000 dalton beta-pseudoglobulin which is composed of two presumably identical 85,000 dalton chains linked by <span class="CHEMICAL">disulfide</span> bonds. The protein reacts with antibody to <span class="GENE">nephritic factor</span>, which is defined by its activity and is found in the serum of patients with certain nephritides. The activity of IF is heat stable. Upon treatment of serum with activators of the alternative pathway, the initial C3 convertase is assembled from IF, Factors D and C, C3, and magnesium without participation of properdin. It is the function of the enzyme to deposit C3b on the surface of the activator particles, thereby affording generation of the solid phase enzymes of the pathway, a process that is a prerequisite for properdin activation. By exposure to low pH, IF assumed the electrophoretic mobility of psi-globulin and acquired the ability to generate without activators a fluid phase C3 convertase in serum. Serum depleted of IF did not allow activation of the properdin pathway. Serum depleted of properdin did permit activation of the pathway and expression of cytolytic activity. These results raise the possibility that IF represents the recognition unit of the pathway.</td></tr></table></div>

The acquisition of a zymogen function by the pancreatic enzymes is accompanied by two major changes to the bacterial enzymes' architecture: an insertion of 9 residues to increase the length of the N-terminal loop, and one of 12 residues to a loop near the activation salt bridge. In addition, in these two enzyme families, the <span class="CHEMICAL">methionine</span> loop (residues 164-182) adopts very different comformations which are associated with their altered substrate specificities.</td></tr></table></div>

Schistosoma mansoni schistosomula recovered from the lungs of inbred mice were shown to possess serologically detectable alloantigens on their tegumental surfaces. Using appropriate antisera and infected congenic and recombinant mice as worm donors, gene products of the K and I subregions of the major histocompatibility complex were demonstrated among these alloantigens acquired by the parasites. In contrast, other cell surface alloantigens, such as Thy 1, Ly 1, and H-Y and the serum proteins albumin, C3 and Ig, could not be detected on the surface of lung schistosomula by means of comparable techniques. In another series of experiments, schistosomula recovered from the lungs of mice and reinjected into allogeneic recipients were shown to exchange their alloantigens during an 87-h period of examination. Similarly, lung schistosomula cocultured with allogeneic lymphocytes were shown to acquire major histocompatibility complex (MHC) coded antigens from the cells.

<div class='PART-OF'><table><tr><td>Rosette formation between human lymphocytes and sheep erythrocytes. Inhibition of rosette formation by specific glycopeptides. Rosette formation with unsensitized sheep erythrocytes is a characteristic of human thymus dependent lymphocytes. Release of glycopeptides from the sheep erythrocyte by trypsin reduces rosette formation. These tryptic glycopeptides inhibit rosette formation by untrypsinized sheep erythrocytes; this suggests that rosetting is mediated by erythrocyte surface glycopeptides. To investigate the molecular nature of this interaction, we examined the abilities of various model compounds to act as haptenic inhibitors of rosette formation. Inhibition is given by glycopeptides bearing oligosaccharide units rich in sialic acid, <span class="CHEMICAL">galactose</span>, N-acetylglucosamine, and mannose linked to asparagine residues through glycosylamine bonds. Among compounds tested, fetuin glycopeptide is most effective, but human <span class="GENE">transferrin</span> glycopeptide and human erythrocyte glycopeptide I also inhibit rosette formation. Other compounds including human erythrocyte glycopeptide II, human IgG glycopeptide, lacto-N-neotetraose, 3'- and 6'-sialyllactose show no significant inhibition. Neither sialic acid, <span class="CHEMICAL">galactose</span>, manose, nor N-acetyl-glucosamine alone inhibits rosette formation. Stepwise degradation of fetuin glycopeptide established the <span class="CHEMICAL">galactose</span> residues as important determinants of inhibitory activity. Fetuin glycopeptide blocks rosette formation when added to a suspension of human lymphocytes and sheep erythrocytes or when preincubated with human lymphocytes, but not when preincubated with sheep erythrocytes. Studies of the binding of [3H] fetuin glycopeptide to normal lymphocytes demonstrate 7.5 x 10(6) saturable binding sites per cell. No saturable binding of this compound to sheep erythrocyte membranes is observed. Compared to normals, lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia demonstrate decreased fetuin glycopeptide binding with a mean of 0.9 x 10(6) sites per cell. This decreased binding correlates with the impaired ability of these cells to form rosettes. The data suggest that fetuin glycopeptide inhibits rosette formation by binding to the thymus-dependent cell where competition occurs with sheep erythrocytes for specific lymphocyte surface receptors.</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='PART-OF'><table><tr><td>Mechanism of pigeon liver <span class="GENE">malic enzyme</span>: kinetics, specificity, and half-site stoichiometry of the alkylation of a <span class="CHEMICAL">cysteinyl</span> residue by the substrate-inhibitor bromopyruvate. <span class="GENE">malic enzyme</span> from pigeon liver is alkylated by the substrate analogue bromopyruvate, resulting in the concomitant loss of its oxidative decarboxylase and oxalacetate decarboxylase activities, but not its ability to reduce alpha-keto acids. The inactivation of oxidative decarboxylase activity follows saturation kinetics, indicating the formation of an enzyme-bromopyruvate complex (K congruent to 8 mM) prior to alkylation. The inactivation is inhibited by metal ions and pyridine nucleotide cofactors. Protection of <span class="GENE">malic enzyme</span> by the substrates L-malate and pyruvate and the inhibitors tartronate and oxalate requires the presence of the above cofactors, which tighten the binding of these carboxylic acids in accord with the ordered kinetic scheme (Hsu, R. Y., Lardy, H. A., and Cleland, W. W. (1967), J. Biol. Chem. 242, 5315-5322). Bromopyruvate is reduced to L-bromolactate by <span class="GENE">malic enzyme</span> and is an effective inhibitor of L-malate and pyruvate in the overall reaction. The apparent kinetic constants (90 muM-0.8 mM) are one to two orders of magnitude lower than the half-saturation constant (K) of inactivation, indicating a similar tightening of bromopyruvate binding in the E-NADP+ (NADPH)-Mn2+ (Mg2+)-BP complexes. During alkylation, bromopyruvate interacts initially at the carboxylic acid substrate pocket of the active site, as indicated by the protective effect of substrates and the ability of this compound to form kinetically viable complexes with <span class="GENE">malic enzyme</span>, particularly as a competitive inhibitor of pyruvate carboxylation with a Ki (90 muM) in the same order as its apparent Michaelis constant of 98 muM. Subsequent alkylation of a <span class="CHEMICAL">cysteinyl</span> residue blocks the C-C bond cleavage step. The incorporation of radioactivity from [14C]bromopyruvate gives a half-site stoichiometry of two carboxyketomethyl residues per tetramer, indicating strong negative cooperativity between the four subunits of equal size, or alternatively the presence of structurally dissimilar active sites.</td></tr></table></div>

A method for the estimation of N-ethoxyformyl (EF)-His at pH 5--7 and of O-ethoxyformyl (EF)-Tyr in alkaline solution by measuring A 242 nm (ximM = 3.2) and A278 nm (ximM = 1.16), respectively, was developed. The formation of EF-His and EF-Tyr was an electrophilic reaction and was dependent on pH, exhibiting pK values of 6.8 and 9.9, respectively. The maximal yield of EF-His at pH 6.0 was 49% of the total histidine content, but no inactivation nor unfolding of the enzyme was observed. The formation of 12 EF-Tyr residues per mole of <span class="GENE">catalase</span> at pH 8.1 did not cause any inactivation, but the formation of 8 more EF-Tyr residues at pH 8.9 resulted in both inactivation and unfolding. Nearly complete inactivation and partial splitting of <span class="GENE">catalase</span> were observed when 43-46 EF-Tyr residues per mole were produced at pH 10.0. More EF-His residues were formed by the reaction of diethyl pyrocarbonate with cyanoethylated (CE)-catalase monomer (subunit) than with CE-catalase tetramer. The CE-catalase tetramer and monomer were extensively O-ethoxyformylated, reaching 100% EF-Tyr formation. These results indicate that a half of the histidine residues may lie outside the protein core and that three-quarters of the <span class="CHEMICAL">tyrosine</span> residues are probably in the protein core of the enzyme. The production of 2--3 EF-Tyr residues per mole of the monomer by ethoxyformylation at pH 7.0 was accompanied by a decrease in the magnitude of the Soret peak.

However, the R3 antigen was found to be distinctive from the M3 antigen in agar gel diffusion tests. In addition, R3 and M3 proteins behaved differently in opsonophagocytosis tests and opsonization inhibition tests. Thus, R3 and M3 proteins produced precipitin lines of nonidentity with an unabsorbed antiserum against whole type 3 streptococci: M3-specific antiserum, but not R3-specific antiserum, enhanced the phagocytosis of type 3 streptococci. Purified M3 but not R3 protein was capable of inhibiting the type-specific opsonization of type 3 streptococci.

The activity of the system increased linearly as the concentration of S-150 supernatant fraction protein increased from 125 to 325 microgram per assay. The optimum Mg2+ concentration was 12.5-15 mM. Ribosomes required treatment with DNAase in order to reduce endogenous activity, but the S-150 fraction was kept DNAase-free to prevent degradation of exogenously added DNA. The coupled system was sensitive to inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis.

Comparative data on quaternary structure, cooperativity, Bohr effect and regulation by organic phosphates are reviewed for vertebrate hemoglobins. A phylogeny of hemoglobin function in the vertebrates is deduced. It is proposed that from the monomeric hemoglobin of the common ancestor of vertebrates, a deoxy dimer, as seen in the lamprey, could have originated with a single <span class="CHEMICAL">amino acid</span> substitution. The deoxy dimer has a Bohr effect, cooperativity and a reduced oxygen affinity compared to the monomer. One, or two, additional <span class="CHEMICAL">amino acid</span> substitutions could have resulted in the origin of a tetrameric deoxy hemoglobin which dissociated to dimers on oxygenation. Gene duplication, giving incipient alpha and beta genes, probably preceded the origin of a tetrameric oxyhemoglobin. The origin of an organic phosphate binding site on the tetrameric hemoglobin of an early fish required only one, or two, <span class="CHEMICAL">amino acid</span> substitutions. ATP was the first organic phosphate regulator of hemoglobin function. The binding of ATP by hemoglobin may have caused the original elevation in the concentration of ATP in the red blood cells by relieving end product inhibition of ATP synthesis.

The influence of the number of <span class="CHEMICAL">penicilloyl</span> residues on the antigenicity of macromolecules as determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA), passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) and antibody induction. The present communication reveals a relationship between the epitope density of penicilloylated protein antigens and their antigenic activities in a radioimmunoassay (RIA), in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) and in inducing antibody formation in mice. In the RIA and PCA a critical number of 2-4 <span class="CHEMICAL">penicilloyl</span> residues per protein molecule was noted. At this level small changes in the number of substituents considerably influenced the antigenic activities. The molecular weight and the nature of the carrier proteins, myoglobin, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and dimeric BSA also affected the threshold concentration for efficient antigenic activity. The results with the RIA and PCA were significantly correlated to each other. Using penicilloylated BSA as immunizing antigen in mice it was found that an epitope number higher than 11 <span class="CHEMICAL">penicilloyl</span> residues per protein molecule induced significant antibody formation after a single injection. Antigens with a lower degree of <span class="CHEMICAL">penicilloyl</span> substitution were less immunogenic. An antigen carrying 0.6 <span class="CHEMICAL">penicilloyl</span> residues per BSA molecule did not induce penicilloyl-specific antibodies even after three injections.

The molecular weight of the fragment by gel filtration on calibrated Sephadex G-100 columns and by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis was 22,500. After reduction of the disulfide bonds followed by alkylation of the resultant thiol groups with iodoacetamide, the fragment retained homogeneity by disc electrophoresis and its molecular weight remained unchanged, indicating that it was composed of a single polypeptide chain.

<div class='PART-OF'><table><tr><td>Rosette formation between human lymphocytes and sheep erythrocytes. Inhibition of rosette formation by specific glycopeptides. Rosette formation with unsensitized sheep erythrocytes is a characteristic of human thymus dependent lymphocytes. Release of glycopeptides from the sheep erythrocyte by trypsin reduces rosette formation. These tryptic glycopeptides inhibit rosette formation by untrypsinized sheep erythrocytes; this suggests that rosetting is mediated by erythrocyte surface glycopeptides. To investigate the molecular nature of this interaction, we examined the abilities of various model compounds to act as haptenic inhibitors of rosette formation. Inhibition is given by glycopeptides bearing oligosaccharide units rich in sialic acid, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and mannose linked to asparagine residues through <span class="CHEMICAL">glycosylamine</span> bonds. Among compounds tested, fetuin glycopeptide is most effective, but human transferrin glycopeptide and human erythrocyte glycopeptide I also inhibit rosette formation. Other compounds including human erythrocyte glycopeptide <span class="GENE">II</span>, human IgG glycopeptide, lacto-N-neotetraose, 3'- and 6'-sialyllactose show no significant inhibition. Neither sialic acid, galactose, manose, nor N-acetyl-glucosamine alone inhibits rosette formation. Stepwise degradation of fetuin glycopeptide established the galactose residues as important determinants of inhibitory activity. Fetuin glycopeptide blocks rosette formation when added to a suspension of human lymphocytes and sheep erythrocytes or when preincubated with human lymphocytes, but not when preincubated with sheep erythrocytes. Studies of the binding of [3H] fetuin glycopeptide to normal lymphocytes demonstrate 7.5 x 10(6) saturable binding sites per cell. No saturable binding of this compound to sheep erythrocyte membranes is observed. Compared to normals, lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia demonstrate decreased fetuin glycopeptide binding with a mean of 0.9 x 10(6) sites per cell. This decreased binding correlates with the impaired ability of these cells to form rosettes. The data suggest that fetuin glycopeptide inhibits rosette formation by binding to the thymus-dependent cell where competition occurs with sheep erythrocytes for specific lymphocyte surface receptors.</td></tr></table></div>

No deamination of the cytosine nucleus was noted during this treatment. Native and denatured DNA samples from calf thymus were treated in 3H2O with cysteine methyl ester at pH 5 and 37 degrees C for 24 h and incorporation of tritium into each DNA base was determined by enzymic digestion of the treated DNA. The order of the specific radioactivity found was cytosine greater than guanine greater than adenine greater than thymine for denatured DNA and guanine greater than adenine approximately cytosine greater than thymine for native DNA. The ratio of radioactivity for denatured/native was 11.6 for cytosine, 1.5 for guanine, 1.8 for adenine and 1.1 for thymine. Hence the incorporation in cytosine under the reaction conditions is preferential for single-stranded, nonhelical regions of DNA.

The corresponding value for guanine was 11.1, for adenine 4.73 and for uracil 3.64. Based on the data obtained, it was deduced that in this tRNA the anticodon loop, the <span class="CHEMICAL">dihydrouridine</span> loop and the extra loop were "exposed" under the conditions employed for the labeling. The 5'-terminal cytosine of the anticodon loop was in a "non-exposed" state, a situation similar to that previously reported for E. coli tyrosine tRNA [Cashmore, A. R., Brown, D. M. &amp; Smith, J.

Under nonreducing conditions, the Cbeta chain migrates appreciably more rapidly on sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gels than the reduced Cbeta chain, reflecting the presence of an intrachain <span class="CHEMICAL">disulfide</span> bond.

<div class='PART-OF'><table><tr><td>Basement membranes: structural and biosynthetic considerations. Basement membranes are extracellular matrices synthesized by a variety of cells including the basal cells of the epidermis; the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and glandular epithelium; the capillary endothelium; the epithelial cells of the glomerulus, the renal tubule, and the lens capsule; and the endothelium of Descemet's membrane. Basement membranes in the mature animal are free of lipids, DNA, and proteoglycans and are composed of dissimilar protein subunits. One of these is a procollagen-like molecule associated with a noncollagenous matrix glycoprotein. The proportion of the latter component varies among basement membranes. These various subunits are stabilized by hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds, and aldehyde-derived cross-links which are so extensive that they render the basement membranes highly insoluble. Immunochemical studies indicate three distinct antigenic components which correspond to the collagenous moiety, its nonhelical extension, and the matrix glycoprotein. The <span class="GENE">collagen</span> component of basement membranes, free of the nonhelical extension, is composed of three identical alpha-chains. It is highly rich in hydroxylysine, 3- and 4-hydroxyproline and contains 4 to 8 residues of half-cystine.

Cardiac myosin obtained from atria had a higher Ca2+-activated ATPase activity than did cardiac myosin from ventricles in various species of animals and in humans. The increased specific activity of Ca2+-activated adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) of atrial myosin appeared to correlate with the level of the activity of ventricular myosin ATPase in the animal, since the same order in ATPase activity, as observed in ventricular myosins from various animals, was noted in atrial myosins. The enzymatic properties of atrial myosin also were characterized by no activation by N-ethylmaleimide, low activating energy, and a lower rate of inactivation at alkaline pH compared with the same properties of ventricular myosin. These findings suggest a difference in the myosin molecule at or near the active site, involving some <span class="CHEMICAL">sulfhydryl</span> groups, between the two types of cardiac myosin. The Mg2+-activated ATPase activity, both in the presence and absence of actin (which is thought to be closely related to the basic contraction mechanism), also was enhanced in atrial myosin. Thus, the ATPase activities of atrial and ventricular myosins were different with special reference to the reaction pathway involving calcium and magnesium ions and appear to account for the difference in the velocity of contraction between the atria and the ventricles.</td></tr></table></div>

Demonstration of a T-cell heteroclitic proliferative response and identification of a topographic antigenic determinant on pigeon cytochrome c whose immune recognition requires two complementing major histocompatibility complex-linked immune response genes. The T-lymphocyte proliferative response to pigeon cytochrome c was studied in the mouse. H-2a and H-2k strains were responders to this antigen whereas H-2b, H-2d, H-2f, H-2ja, H-2p, H-2q, H-2r, H-2s, and H-2u strains were low or nonresponders. Genetic mapping demonstrated that two major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-linked Ir genes control the response, one in I-A, the other in I-E/I-C. The major antigenic determinant recognized in this response was localized by cross-stimulations with species variants and cyanogen bromide cleavage fragments of cytochrome c. It was found to be a topographic surface determinant composed of an isoleucine for valine substitution at residue 3, a glutamine for <span class="CHEMICAL">lysine</span> substitution at residue 100 and a <span class="CHEMICAL">lysine</span> for glutamic acid substitution at residue 104. Tobacco hornworm moth cytochrome c, which contains a glutamine at residue 100 but a terminal <span class="CHEMICAL">lysine</span> at residue 103 (one amino acid closer to the glutamine), stimulated pigeon cytochrome c immune T <span class="GENE">cells</span> better than the immunogen. This result demonstrates for the first time a functional T-cell heteroclitic proliferative response in a system under Ir gene control. Immunization with the cyanogen bromide cleavage fragments revealed that only pigeon cytochrome c fragment 81-104 was immunogenic. This fragment primed for a T-cell proliferative response whose specificity was nearly identical to that of the T-cell response primed for by the whole molecule, suggesting that the glutamine at 100 and the <span class="CHEMICAL">lysine</span> at 104 form the immunodominant portion of the antigenic site. Furthermore, mixing experiments using the two cross-reacting antigens, hippopotamus cytochrome c and Pekin duck or chicken cytochrome c fragment (81-104), each of which contains only one of the two immunodominant substitutions, demonstrated that the T lymphocytes responding to the major antigenic determinant comprise a single family of clones that recognize both amino acids as part of the same determinant. Thus, two complementing MHC-linked Ir genes can control the immune response to a single antigenic determinant.</td></tr></table></div>

A series of IgG, IgA, IgM and IgD were examined for the presence of a VHIII variable region subgroup antigenic determinant.

Conversion of residues from helical or pleated-sheet geometry to some intermediate geometry, as followed by means of the amide I and III lines, reveals that substantial amounts of the helical and pleated-sheet conformations remain at 70 degrees C. Changes in the strength of hydrogen bonding by the <span class="CHEMICAL">tyrosyl</span> residues are indicated by the intensity ratio of the doublet at 830-850 cm(-1) and changes in the geometry of the disulfide bridges by the frequency and half-width of the Raman line near 510 cm(-1) due to the S-S vibration. Vibrations of C-S bonds in the methionines and cystines are used to monitor conformational changes in these residues. While there are small quantitative differences in temperature dependence among these probes, all agree in placing the malting temperature at or near 62 degrees C. The Raman data are quantitatively consistent with the six-stage scheme of unfolding of A.W. Burgess and H.A. Scheraga [(1975), J.

A., and Boedefeld, E. (1976) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 420, 177). Changing the pH from neutral to alkaline conditions results in a large spectral shift of the absorption band associated with the NBD chromophore (Aboderin, A. A., Boedefeld, E., and Luisi, P. L. (1973) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 328, 30). In the present work it is shown that this spectral change is due to the formation of a sigma complex in which a hydroxyl ion is added to the aromatic nucleus of the nitrobenzoxadiazole system. Circular dichroic studies suggest that the NBD group is held in a conformationally rigid state in the protein. The kinetics of the spectral change accompanying the formation of the sigma complex has been investigated with a rapid mixing stopped flow spectrophotometer both in the modified enzyme and in the low molecular weight model compounds N-acetyl-(O-NBD)-L-tyrosinamide and glycyl-(O-NBD)-L-tyrosine. In the pH range from 10.1 to 12.7, the time course of the reaction is first order in the case of the modified enzyme (k = 4.8 s-1) and bimolecular and much slower (under pseudo-first order conditions) in the low molecular weight compounds. It is suggested that in the enzyme the reaction proceeds much faster because of the hydrophobic environment around the reacting groups. It is further suggested that the unimolecularity in the enzyme is due to a rate-determining isomerization step, probably connected with a local rearrangement of the protein conformation following the ionization of Tyr-20.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='PART-OF'><table><tr><td>A competitive labeling method for the determination of the chemical properties of solitary functional groups in proteins. The properties of the functional groups in a protein can be used as built-in-probes of the structure of the protein.

The method may be applied to the side chain of histidine, <span class="CHEMICAL">tyrosine</span>, lysine, and cysteine, as well as to the amino terminus of the protein. The method, which is an extension of the competitive labeling technique using [3H]- and [14C]1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (N2ph-F) in a double-labeling procedure, is rapid and sensitive. Advantage is taken of the fact that after acid hydrolysis of a dinitrophenylated protein, a derivative is obtained which must be derived from a unique position in the protein. The method has been applied to the solitary histidine residue of lysozyme, alpha-lytic protease, and Streptomyces griseus (S.G.) trypsin, as well as to the amino terminus of the latter protein. The following parameters were obtained for reaction with N2ph-F at 20 degrees C in 0.1 N KCl: the histidine of hen egg-white lysozyme, pKa of 6.4 and second-order velocity constant of 0.188 M-1 min-1; the histidine of alpha-lytic protease, pKa of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of 0.0235 M-1 min-1; the histidine of <span class="GENE">s.g. trypsin</span>, pKa of 6.5 and second-order velocity constant of 0.0328 M-1 min-1; the valyl amino terminus of <span class="GENE">s.g. trypsin</span>, pKa of 8.1 and second-order velocity constant of 0.403 M-1 min-1.

The spectral change was specific for adenine nucleotide binding and was greater with ATP than with AMP. In the x-ray model, <span class="CHEMICAL">tyr153</span> and Tyr154 are located at a hinge region of two domains which form a deep active site cleft and are therefore susceptible to conformational change on substrate binding.

Platelets from patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia have a distinct molecular alteration of the plasma membrane surface, namely decreased amounts of a major glycoprotein designated as IIb (apparent mol wt 142,000). To identify other possible surface defects of thrombasthenic platelets, we labeled the membrane polypeptides of normal and thrombasthenic platelets by two different techniques: lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination and galactose oxidase oxidation, followed by reduction with tritiated sodium borohydride. Labeling patterns were determined after the polypeptides were separated by two-dimensional <span class="CHEMICAL">polyacrylamide</span> gel electrophoresis. Before the second dimension was run, platelet samples were incubated with a reducing agent, beta-mercapto-ethanol, to cleave the disulfide bonds of certain glycoproteins; the resulting changes in electrophoretic mobility permitted better resolution of individual molecules. Comparison of the labeled polypeptides of normal and thrombasthenic samples after reduction indicated decreased labeling of two major glycoproteins in thrombasthenic platelets: IIb and III (apparent mol wt 114,000). The relative proportions of radioactivity incorporated by these polypeptides were about 60 and 80% less than control values, respectively. With either Coomassie Blue or periodic acid-Schiff's reagent, <span class="GENE">glycoprotein iii</span> stained much less intensely in thrombasthenic compared to normal samples, indicating that the observed labeling deficit was caused by a decreased concentration of the molecule rather than steric inaccessibility on the membrane surface. Analysis of normal plasma membranes by affinity chromatography showed that glycoprotein IIb has receptors for lectin from Lens culinaris, the common lentil, whereas III does not.

The affinity label N-bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate (BrAcNHEtOP) has been used previously at pH 6.5 to identify His-359 of <span class="GENE">rabbit muscle aldolase</span> as an active site residue. We now find that the specificity of the reagent is pH-dependent. At pH 8.5, alkylation with 14C-labeled BrAcNHEtOP abolishes both fructose-1,6-P2 cleavage activity and transaldolase activity. The stoichiometry of incorporation, the kinetics of inactivation, and the protection against inactivation afforded by a competitive inhibitor or dihydroxyacetone phosphate are consistent with the involvement of an active site residue. A comparison of 14C profiles obtained from chromatography on the amino acid analyzer of acid hydrolysates of inactivated and protected samples reveals that inactivation results from the alkylation of lysyl residues. The major peptide in tryptic digests of the inactivated enzyme has been isolated. Based on its amino acid composition and the known sequence of aldolase, <span class="CHEMICAL">lys-146</span> is the residue preferentially alkylated by the reagent. Aldolase modified at His-359 is still subject to alkylation of lysine; thus <span class="CHEMICAL">lys-146</span> and His-359 are not mutually exclusive sites. However, aldolase modified at <span class="CHEMICAL">lys-146</span> is not subject to alkylation of histidine. One explanation of these observations is that modification of <span class="CHEMICAL">lys-146</span> abolishes the binding capacity of aldolase for substrates and substrate analogs (BrAcNHEtOP), whereas modification of his-359 does not. Consistent with this explanation is the ability of aldolase modified at His-359 to form a Schiff base with substrate and the inability of aldolase modified at <span class="CHEMICAL">lys-146</span> to do so. Therefore, <span class="CHEMICAL">lys-146</span> could be one of the cationic groups that functions in electrostatic binding of the substrate's phosphate groups.</td></tr></table></div>

Avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) contains two forms of RNA-directed DNA polymerase, alpha, consisting of a single polypeptide of molecular weight 65,000, and alphabeta, consisting of two polypeptides of molecular weights 65,000 and 105,000. The alpha and alphabeta forms of AMV DNA polymerase both possess RNase H activity that requires free end termini on the ribopolymer and can degrade the RNA of the RNA-DNA hybrid in the 3' to 5' and 5' to 3' directions. But, alpha and alphabeta possess a different mode of <span class="GENE">exoribonuclease</span> activity. While alphabeta RNase H is a processive <span class="GENE">exoribonuclease</span> that degrades the polynucleotide chain to a core residue before attacking a second chain, alpha RNase H is a random <span class="GENE">exoribonuclease</span> that releases the polynucleotide after each scission.

Poly (A) segments were isolated from viral 60-70S and 35S RNA by treatment with RNase A or RNase T1 and purified by afinity chromatography and gel electrophoresis. Viral poly(A) was shown to be present at the 3' terminus as -G(C,U)A190AOH. The similar sequence reported for poly(A) present in mammalian mRNA suggests that similar mechanisma are involved in the transcription and processing of both cellular and viral DNA sequences. Within transformed cells replicating MSV(MLV), viral 35S and 20S RNA were found in membrane-bound polyribosomes, whereas only 35S RNA was detected in free polyribosomes. The origin and function of 20S RNA is unknown. The early events during rapid infection and cell transformation of mouse 3T6 cells by the Harvey strain of MSV(MLV) were studied. By both autoradiographic analysis and molecular hybridization, viral DNA synthesis was detected in the cytoplasm by 1 hour after infection, reached a maximum at 2 hours, and subsequently decreased. Cytological chase experiments produced evidence that cytoplasmic viral DNA was transported to the nucleus. In situ hybridization experiments using radioactive viral DNA product as a probe demonstrated the rapid association of viral DNA sequences with the chromocenters of interphase nuclei and with the centromeric heterochromatin regions of some chromosomes.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='PART-OF'><table><tr><td>Studies on the isolation and partial characterization of <span class="GENE">apolipoprotein</span> D and lipoprotein D of human plasma. This report describes further studies on the characterization of <span class="GENE">apolipoprotein</span> D (ApoD), a recently recognized human plasma <span class="GENE">apolipoprotein</span>, and presents results on the isolation and distribution of its lipoprotein form, lipoprotein D (LP-D). ApoD, isolated by a procedure combining hydroxylapatite and Sephadex G-100 column chromatography, migrated on 7% polyacrylamide gel as a single band with a mobility intermediate between those of A-II and C-II polypeptides. On double diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis, ApoD reacted only with antiserum to ApoD. It was characterized by the presence of all common <span class="CHEMICAL">amino acids</span> including half-cystine. The amino terminal acid was blocked. Carbohydrate analysis demonstrated that ApoD is a glycoprotein with glucose, mannose, galactose, glucosamine, and sialic acid accounting for 18% of the dry weight of ApoD. The estimated molecular weight of ApoD IS 22 100. ApoD occurs in the serum as a lipoprotein which was isolated from high density lipoproteins3 by two different chromatographic procedures. In the first procedure, high density lipoproteins3 were treated with neuraminidase and chromatographed on concanavlin A. The retained fraction containing LP-D was purified by hydroxylapatite column chromatography. Alternatively, LP-D was isolated by a procedure combining chromatography of high density lipoproteins3 or whole serum on an immunosorber containing antibodies to ApoD, and hydroxylapatite column chromatography. LP-D displayed a single, symmetrical boundary in the analytical ultracentrifuge and a single band on 7% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When injected into rabbits it produced antisera that reacted only with ApoD. On immunoelectrophoresis LP-D had a mobility different from that of lipoprotein A (LP-A). A direct immunological comparison of LP-D and LP-A showed a reaction of nonidentity. LP-D consists of 65-75% protein and 25-35% lipid. The lipid moiety contains cholesterol, cholesterol ester, triglyceride, and phospholipid. The phospholipid. composition is characterized by a relative high content of lysolecithin and sphingomyelin and a relatively low content of lecithin. We have concluded from these studies that ApoD is a unique <span class="GENE">apolipoprotein</span> that exists in the form of a distinct lipoprotein family with a macromolecular distribution extending from very low density lipoproteins into very high density lipoproteins, but with a maximum concentration in high density lipoproteins3 and a minimum concentration in high density lipoproteins.</td></tr></table></div>

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate D-glyceraldehyde-3-phyosphate-lyase, EC 4.1.2.13) was isolated from buffalo muscle by fractionation with ammonium sulphate and subsequent purification by phosphocellulose column chromatography using a linear salt gradient. As judged by gel filtration and electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel, the enzyme was homogeneous with respect to size and charge. The molecular weight and Stokes radius of the enzyme were determined from its elution profile on a calibrated Sephadex column and the respective values were 162000 and 4.55 nm. The diffusion coefficient and frictional ratio were computed to be 4.8-10(7) cm2-s-1 and 1.27, respectively. The molecular weight of the polypeptide chain as measured by aodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 40750. This taken together with the native molecular weight suggested a four-subunit model for the protein. The  N- AND C-terminal residues of polypeptide chains were identified to be <span class="CHEMICAL">proline</span> and tyrosine, respectively. At pH 8.0 the Michaelis-Menten constant and maximum attainable velocity were found to be 8.1 muM and 27 muM Fru-1,6-P2 split/min per mg, respectively.

The antibacterial activity of a myeloperoxidase (MPO)-glucose oxidase system was found to be greatly increased by granulocyte elastase, present in azurophil granules of human neutrophils. The MPO-H2O3-mediated killing of both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was potentiated by <span class="GENE">granuocyte elastase</span> at an acid pH, whereas at pH 7.4 only killing of E. coli was potentiated. The potentiating effect of elastase was not dependent on the enzymatic properties of the protein since it was not abolished by heating, which destroys the enzymatic activity. A peptide <span class="CHEMICAL">chloromethyl ketone</span> elastase inhibitor abolished both elastolytic activity and the pctentiating effects on MPO-H2-O2-mediated bacterial killing. The antibacterial activity of chymotrypsin-like cationic protein of human neutrophils was also potentiated by elastase. Other degradative enzymes isolated from human granulocytes, e.g., collagenase and lysozyme, did not potentiate MPO-H2O2-mediated or cationic protein-dependent bacterial killing. The present study indicates that a neutrophil constitutent, elastase, which is not microbicidal by itself, can initiate sublethal changes that render some microorganisms more susceptible to the action of microbicidal agents like MPO and chymotrypsin-like cationic protein.</td></tr></table></div>

These g values are somewhat different from those of horse heart cytochrome c and can be interpreted by the generalizations of Brautigan et al. [(1977) J. Biol.

In order to obtain information on the nature of the amino acid residues involved in the activity of ribonuclease U1 [EC 3.1.4.8], various chemical modifications of the enzyme were carried out. RNase U1 was inactivated by reaction with iodoacetate at pH 5.5 with concomitant incorporation of 1 carboxymethyl group per molecule of the enzyme. The residue specifically modified by iodoacetate was identified as one of the glutamic acid residues, as in the case of <span class="GENE">rnase t1</span>. The enzyme was also inactivated extensively by reaction with iodoacetamide at pH 8.0 with the loss of about one residue each of <span class="CHEMICAL">histidine</span> and lysine. When RNase U1 was treated with a large excess of phenylglyoxal, the enzymatic activity and binding ability toward 3'-GMP were lost, with simultaneous modification of about 1 residue of arginine. The reaction of citraconic anhydride with RNase U1 led to the loss of enzymatic activity and modification of about 1 residue of lysine. The inactivated enzyme, however, retained binding ability toward 3'-GMP. These results indicate that there are marked similarities in the active sites of RNases T1 and U1.</td></tr></table></div>

M15 protein lacks residues 11--41 and is a dimer; the active complex, like native beta-galactosidase, is tetrameric [Langley, K. E., &amp; Zabin, I. (1976) Biochemistry 15, 4866--4875]. A dimer--dimer binding region in beta-galactosidase has been identified by proteolytic and immunologic studies of alpha-complementation. Proteolytic experiments were carried out with <span class="GENE">trypsin</span>. Treatment of native beta-galactosidase with <span class="GENE">trypsin</span>, followed by reaction of the mixture with cyanogen bromide, yields intact CNBr2 as measured by its ability to complement M15 protein. Active CNBr2 is not obtained when urea-denatured beta-galactosidase is treated in the same way. Therefore the segment corresponding to CNBr2 is apparently buried within the folded protein. Immunologic experiments were carried out with antibodies against CNBr2, tryptic peptide T8 (residues 60--140), and CNBr3 (residues 93--187). Anti-CNBr2 and anti-T8 bind to M15 protein but not to beta-galactosidase, indicating that this area is exposed in the dimer. Anti CNBr2, but not anti-T8 or anti-CNBr3, inhibits the formation of alpha-complemented enzyme. These results indicate that an early part of the sequence, within the segment corresponding to CNBr2, is involved in dimer--dimer interaction.</td></tr></table></div>

Spectrophotometric pH titrations of phosphoglycerate kinase (<span class="GENE">EC 2.7.2.3</span>) reveal seven tyrosyl residues. In the native state one tyrosyl residue has pKapp equal to 9.3, another has pKapp of about 12.9, and five have pKapp values close to 11.0. Titration above pH 10 causes concomitant reduction of the catalytic activity. Reactivation of the enzyme occurs during storage at pH 7.8. In 6 M guanidine - HCl seven tyrosyl residues with pKapp values equal to 10.0 appear. Nitration of three tyrosyl residues occurs easily when tetranitromethane is used in excess. Four tyrosyl residues appear to be masked or buried. The tyrosyl residue having pKapp equal to 9.3 can be selectively nitrated. Simultaneously the enzyme loses 40% of its catalytic activity. No change in the Km value for one or the other of the two substrates, MgATP or 3-phospho-D-glycerate, was observed in the mononitrated enzyme. On the other hand MgATP protects the tyrosyl residue from nitration whereas 3-phospho-D-glycerate at corresponding condition appears harmless. These results suggest the low ionizing tyrosyl residue to be situated close to the binding site of MgATP, possibly in a pocket just behind. Circular dichroism measurements indicated that minor successive changes occur in the secondary structure, mainly the beta-structure, when the enzyme is being nitrated. It is reasonable to think that these structural changes, possible in combination with steric hindrance, are responsible for the decrease in catalytic activity.

The plasma membrane of extragonadal somatic cells absorbed 1.2 to 2.8% of these hydrophobic proteins. The unoccupied H-Y receptor sites residing on the plasma membrane of bovine fetal ovarian cells, on the other hand, selectively absorbed polymers of 18,000 mol. wt. subunits, and this antigen-receptor interaction, if allowed to continue for five days, induced the formation of tunica albuginea and seminiferous tubules in bovine XX embryonic indifferent gonads. In this manner, human H-Y antigen excreted by Daudi cells has functionally been identified as a series of polymers derived from 18,000 mol. wt. subunits. While, the H-Y antigenic determinants were retained even by the largest polymeric form that became irreversibly water insoluble, the receptor binding activity was shown only by 36.8% of the available polymeric forms of 18,000 mol. wt. subunits, at the most. Nevertheless, once bound to the receptor site, these polymers were rapidly reduced to the monomeric form on the plasma membrane of bovine fetal ovarian cells.

A time-dependent conversion of NCS to PRE at pH 3.2 at 4 degrees or in 0.1 M acetic acid at 26 degrees was studied in two ways; first, by quantitative determination of NCS and PRE by CM-cellulose column chromatography and second, by following the release of free NH3 during dialysis in an air-tight container. Within experimental error, PRE was indistinguishable from NCS in amino acid content after acid hydrolysis, as well as in apparent molecular weight as determined by SDS-disc gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide), and N- and C-terminal amino acid residues. Both NCS and PRE shared a common antigenicity as determined by Ouchterlony's agar diffusion method. Only a slight difference between the two in electrophoresis on a cellulose acetate membrane and on a peptide map of the tryptic digest was demonstrated. PRE, however, was completely devoid of biological activity. In addition to the chromatographic difference, a conformational difference was observed by CD spectroscopy, namely, an apparently looser structure of PRE was indicated by the shallowness of the trough in the 240-265 nm region. This interpretation was supported by the finding that digestions by <span class="GENE">pronase</span> were more extensive with PRE than with NCS.

A lambda light chain, isolated from an immunoglobulin G molecule, was found to reversibly precipitate at low temperatures. This cryoprecipitation was a function of pH, ionic strength, protein concentration, and time as well as temperature. The lambda chain underwent a cooperative conformational change as the temperature was lowered from 26 to 0 degrees C as judged by ultraviolet difference spectroscopy and circular dichroism. Normal lambda chains showed no conformational change. By difference spectroscopy it was possible to calculate the equilibrium constant governing the conformational change. The  change was strongly exothermic (delta H approximately -80 kcal mol-1) and accompanied by a large decrease in entropy (delta S approximately -280 eu). The midpoint of the transition was dependent on the initial protein concentration, suggesting that only the noncovalent dimer of the lambda chain exhibited the conformational change. The existence of a monomer-dimer eqiulibrium (KA approximately 4 X 10(5) M-1) was confirmed by sedimentation velocity. No conformational change was observed by circular dichroism at concentrations where greater than 95% of lambda chain was in the form of a monomer. Although high ionic strength inhibited cryoprecipitation, it had no effect on the conformational change. Stabilization of the dimer by forming an interchain <span class="CHEMICAL">disulfide</span> bond between two monomers abolished both the conformational change and cryoprecipitation. A fragment corresponding to the constant region was isolated from both peptic and tryptic digests of the lambda chain. This fragment neither cryoprecipitated nor showed temperature dependence conformational changes. It proved impossible to isolate a fragment corresponding to the variable region. Both qualitative and quantitative models are presented to account for the behavior of the lambda chain at low temperatures.</td></tr></table></div>

We have examined the ability of two purified peptide fragments derived from hen (chicken) egg-white lysozyme (HEL); N-terminal, Co-terminal peptide (a.a. 1--17:cys 6--cys 127:120--129) and mixed disulfide LII peptide (LII) (a.a. 13--105) to induce antigen-specific suppression or help in B10 (H-2b) nonresponder and B10.A (H-2a) responder mice. An anti-HEL primary in vitro antibody response can be obtained in either strain by stimulation with HEL coupled to erythrocytes (RBC). Preimmunization with HEL-complete Freund's adjuvant-(CFA) or N-C-CFA-induced suppression of the anti-HEL PFC response to HEL-RBC in spleen cell cultures from B10 mice, whereas helper activity was demonstrated in cultures from B10.A mice similarly immunized. LII-CFA priming elicited helper cells in both C57BL/10 Sn (B10) and B10.A/SgSn (B10.A) mice. The genetic nonresponsiveness of B10 mice to HEL can therefore be attributed to the activation of suppressor T cells by a limited portion of the <span class="CHEMICAL">molecule</span> (e.g., N-C) which prevent the potential response directed against other epitopes on the same <span class="CHEMICAL">molecule</span> (e.g., LII).

The inactivation was pH-dependent and was not restored by treatment with hydroxylamine. The addition of glycine ethyl ester or N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-ethylenediamine (DNP-EDA) markedly increased the rate of inactivation. Of the various amino analogs of glucose tested, only glucosyl amine accelerated the inactivation, although they are all bound to the glucose 1-phosphate site of the enzyme. In the absence of amines, incorporation of about 3 mol of [metho-14C]CMC per protein monomer was observed on complete inactivation. In the presence of DNP-EDA, however, only 2 mol of [metho-14C]CMC and 1 mol of DNP-EDA were incorporated before the activity was completely lost. The treatment of phosphorylase b with CMC did not change the Km values of the enzyme for glucose 1-phosphate and AMP, in spite of the 56% inactivation.

The two smallest peptides, BCCP(SC) and BCCP(9,100), with molecular weights of 8,900 and 9,100, respectively, exhibit unusual positive CD bands centered at 237 nm and 220 nm. BCCP(10,400), with a molecular weight of 10,400, has a CD spectrum intermediate between <span class="GENE">BCCP</span> and that of the smallest peptides. Since d-biotin exhibits a positive CD band at 233 nm, it was suspected that the biotin prosthetic group might be the chromophore responsible for the 237 nm CD band seen in BCCP(SC) and BCCP(9,100). Enzymatic carboxylation of BCCP(SC) to form CO2-BCCP(SC) caused the CD spectrum to change with a shift of the 237 nm band to 232 nm. The positive CD band at 220 nm was unaffected by carboxylation of the biotin prosthetic group. These date suggest that the 237 nm signal may be due either to the biotin which acts as a chromophore directly or to a chromophore that is perturbed by the carboxylation of biotin. A spectropolarimetric titration was carried out to investigate the possible contribution of the single tyrosine residue of BCCP(SC) to the CD spectrum of this peptide. At pH values over 9 the CD spetrum changed with the disappearance of the 237 nm band, suggesting that tyrosine might contribute to this CD band. Denaturation of BCCP(SC) or BCCP(9,100) with 8 M urea of 6 M guanidine HCl abolished the positive CD bands and resulted in spectra typical of a random coil, whereas treatment of BCCP(SC) with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate abolished the positive bands and left a spectrum exhibiting a shoulder at 222 nm and a negative band at 205 nm, suggestive of a high degree of ordered structure. It is concluded that the CD band at 237 nm in BCCP(SC) and BCCP(9,100) is prabably due to a noncovalent interaction of biotin with an <span class="CHEMICAL">amino acid</span> residue(s) of the protein. It is suggested that the biotin prosthetic group is partially buried in the surface of the protein, rather than swinging free at the end of the lysine side chain through which it is covalently linked to the protein, to permit this interaction to occur.</td></tr></table></div>

The aromatic proton resonances in the 360-MHz 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease were divided into histidine, tyrosine and phenylalanine resonances by means of pH titrations and double resonance experiments. 2. Photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization spectra showed that one histidine (His-119) and two tyrosines are accessibly to photo-excited flavin. This permitted the identification of the C-4 proton resonance of His-119. 3. The resonances of the ring protons of Tyr-25, Tyr-76 and <span class="CHEMICAL">tyr-115</span> and the C-4 proton of His-12 were identified by comparison with subtilisin-modified and nitrated ribonucleases. Other resonances were assigned tentatively to Tyr-73, Tyr-92 and Phe-46. 4. On addition of active-site inhibitors, all phenylalanine resonances broadened or disappeared. The resonance that was most affected was assigned tentatively to Phe-120. 5. Four of the six tyrosines of bovine RNase, identified as Tyr-76, <span class="CHEMICAL">tyr-115</span> and, tentatively, Tyr-73 and Tyr-92, are titratable above pH 9. The rings of Tyr-73 and <span class="CHEMICAL">tyr-115</span> are rapidly rotating or flipping by 180 degrees about their C beta--C gamma bond and are accessible to flavin in photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization experiments. Tyr-25 is involved in a pH-dependent conformational transition, together with Asp-14 and His-48. A scheme for this transition is proposed. 6. Binding of active-site inhibitors to bovine RNase only influences the active site and its immediate surroundings. These conformational changes are probably not connected with the pH-dependent transition in the region of Asp-14, Tyr-25 and His-48. 7.

Thermal denaturation of chromatin was assayed in situ in fixed round, elongating and elongated spermatids and in testicular sperm from mice. Production of single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at elevated temperatures was monitored by digesting chromatin with endonuclease specific for single-stranded DNA (S1 nuclease), staining the residual DNA with gallocyanin-chrome alum (GAC) and measuring the stain content by absorption cytophotometry.

Both round and elongating spermatid stages showed a significantly greater sensitivity to <span class="GENE">nuclease</span> digestion than did more mature stages; sperm showed no effects of <span class="GENE">nuclease</span> action below 80 degrees C.

Thermal denaturation of round spermatids labeled with 3H-thymidine produced no change in autoradiographic mean nuclear grain counts, indicating no loss of thymidine-labeled DNA from the slides during denaturation. When round spermatids and sperm were hydrolyzed with hot tricholoroacetic acid before staining, both nuclear GCA content and autoradiograph grain count were partially reduced, indicating incomplete DNA removal.

In partial answer to the question of how such tissues are able to avoid disrupting transients to functions sensitive to protein charge states, model studies were carried out to assess the passive intracellular buffer system response to a combined change in body temperature and CO2 partial pressure as occurs in vivo in these species. The cell compartment was modeled as a closed volume of ternary buffer solution, containing protein <span class="CHEMICAL">imidazole</span> (50 mM/1); phosphate (15 mM/1) and CO2-bicarbonate buffer components, permeable only to CO2 and permitted no change in buffer base. Excursions from a steady-state non-equilibrium pHi were computed to a step-change in temperature/PCO2. Computations for frog (Rana catesbeiana) striated muscle show that the calculated pHi response on the basis of estimated composition and concentration of cell buffer components, moves along the curve describing the steady-state temperature relationship. No transient away from steady-state alphaIM and carbon dioxide content need be postulated. Applications to turtle (Pseudemys scripta) striated muscle are also explored.

When N-[14C] acetylbenzotriazole, presented here as a new agent for the acetylation of <span class="GENE">proteins</span>, reacted at pH 8 and 25 degrees C with delta-chymotrypsin, 15 amino groups (the epsilon-amino groups of lysing residues and the alpha-amino terminus of half-cystine-1) and two <span class="CHEMICAL">phenolic</span> groups (those of the two exposed tyrosine residues) were acetylated with respective pseudo first-order constants of 0.056 +/- 0.003 and 0.15 +/- 0.03 min(-1). Surprisingly, in contrast with the acetic anhydride reaction, the alpha-amino group of Ile-16 was found to be not acetylated as shown by N-terminus determination and activity measurements: the modified delta-chymotrypsin (or acetylated delta-chymotrypsin) was fully active after neutral dialysis. Only a transient inactivation due to the incorporation of one [14C] acetyl group per mole of catalytic site was observed. The kinetic constant found for reactivation at pH 8.5 was 0.315 +/- 0.005 min(-1) at 25 degrees C. The enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of N-acetylbenzotriazole was described by a k(cat) value of 0.093 +/- 0.005 min(-1) at pH 7 and 25 degrees C. Circular dichroism changes observed at 230 nm during the reaction at pH 8.5, of acetylated delta-chymotrypsin with N-acetylbenzotriazole indicated a total conversion of the amount of enzyme molecules which were in the 'inactive' or 'alkaline' conformation at this pH, into the 'active' or 'neutral' one. Benzotriazole alone was unable to induce such a conformational change. The rate constant of the reverse structural process from the 'neutral' to the 'alkaline' conformation was 0.32 +/- 0.02 min(-1): identical to that of the deacetylation of the catalytic site. Thus, the unusual lack of acetylation of Ile-16 alpha-amino group during delta-chymotrypsin treatment with N-acetylbenzotriazole is interpreted as a stabilization of the enzyme 'neutral' conformation where the Ile-16 alpha-amino group is buried, thus inaccessible to the reagent. The properties of the delta-chymotrypsin modification using N-acetylbenzotriazole led to practical uses: direct spectrophotometric titration of chymotrypsin operational normality at pH 7 and rapid preparation of acetylated delta-chymotrypsin.

A hypothesis is proposed about the universality of the mechanisms involved in transmitter release and utilization and the key role of the membrane ATP-ase system in these processes. During depolarization of the pre-SM the increase in membrane permeability is ascribed to the loosening of protein-lipid bonds and inhibition of ATP-ase activity involved in transport mechanisms. During depolarization the number of complementary contacts between SV and the pre-SM increase probably through the action of myosin-like and actin-like proteins localized on the SV and pre-SM, respectively. The release of transmitters and polypeptides is thought to be initiated by an increased concentration of Ca2+ in the synaptoplasm which induces contraction of the actomyosin-like complex. Changes in the Na-gradient brought about by the activity of Na, K-ATP-ase, are involved in the active reuptake of transmitters from the synaptic cleft.

The trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitor from chick peas (CI) is stable in HCl 0.001 M -- 0.01 M and in KOH 0.01 M -- 0.05 M even after 24 h. Increased KOH concentrations decrease considerably the inhibitory activity already after 1 h. Maleyation and succinylation of the inhibitor resulted in almost full loss of its trypsin-inhibitory activity but had no effect on the chymotrypsin-inhibitory activity. A series of modifications directed towards tyrosyl residues showed that iodination influenced only the chymotrypsin-inhibitory activity; however, nitration and arsanilation affected not only the chymotrypsin-inhibitory activity but also the trypsin-inhibitory activity. Treatment of the inhibitor with CNBr and chloramine T resulted only in a decrease in the chymotrypsin-inhibitory activity indicating that the only methionine is involved in the chymotrypsin-inhibitory activity.

Some physical, catalytic, and regulatory properties of <span class="GENE">ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase</span> (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate: alpha-ketoisovalerate hydroxymethyltranferase) from Escherichia coli are described. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible synthesis of ketopantoate (Reaction 1), an essential precursor of pantothenic acid. (1) HC(CH3)2COCOO- + 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate f in equilibrium r HOCH2C(CH3)2COCOO- + tetrahydrofolate  It has a molecular weight by sedimentation equilibrium of 255,000, a sedimentation coefficient (S20,w) of 11 S, a partial specific volume of 0.74 ml/g, an isoelectric point of 4.4, and an absorbance, (see article), of 0.85. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and amino acid analyses give a subunit molecular weight of 27,000 and 25,700, respectively; both procedures indicate the presence of 10 identical subunits. The NH2-terminal sequence is Met-Tyr---. The enzyme is stable and active over a broad pH range, with an optimum from 7.0 to 7.6. It requires Mg2+ for activity; Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+ are progressively less active. The enzyme is not inactivated by borohydride reduction in the presence of excess substrates, i.e. it is a Class II aldolase. Reaction 1f is partially inhibited by concentrations of formaldehyde (0.8 mM) and tetrahydrofolate (0.38 mM) below or near the Km values, apparent Km values are 0.18, 1.1 and 5.9 mM for tetrahydrofolate, alpha-ketoisovalerate, and formaldehyde, respectively. For Reaction 1r, apparent Km values are 0.16 and 0.18 mM, respectively, for ketopantoate and tetrahydrofolate, and the saturation curves for both substrates show positive cooperativity. Forward and reverse reactions occur at similar maximum velocities (Vmax approximately equal to 8 mumol of ketopantoate formed or decomposed per min per mg of enzyme at 37 degrees). Only 1-tetrahydrofolate is active in Reaction 1; d-tetrahydrofolate, folate, and methotrexate were neither active nor inhibitory. However, 1-tetrahydrofolate was effectively replaced with conjugates containing 1 to 6 additional glutamate residues; of these, tetrahydropterolpenta-, tetra-, and triglutamate were effective at lower concentrations than tetrahydrofolate itself; they were also the predominant conjugates of tetrahydrofolate present in E. coli. Alpha-Ketobutyrate, alpha-ketovalerate, and alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate replaced alpha-ketoisovalerate as substrates; pyruvate was inactive as a substrate, but like isovalerate, 3-methyl-2-butanone and D- or L-valine, inhibited Reaction 1. the transferase has regulatory properties expected of an enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in a biosynthetic pathway. Pantoate (greater than or equal to 500 muM) and coenzyme A (above 1 mM) all inhibit; the Vmax is decreased, Km is increased, and the cooperativity for substrate (ketopantoate) is enhanced. Catalytic activity of the transferase is thus regulated by the products of the reaction path of which it is one component; transferase synthesis is not repressed by growth in the presence of <span class="CHEMICAL">pantothenate</span>.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='PART-OF'><table><tr><td>A chromatin-bound proteolytic activity with unique specificity for histone H2A. A protease associated with purified calf thymus chromatin has been found to act exclusively upon histone H2A, yielding a single new protein species, cH2A. This fragment migrates faster than H2A in acrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. The cH2A was purified and subjected to <span class="CHEMICAL">amino acid</span> analysis and partial sequencing by the use of carboxypeptidase A. These studies demonstrated that cH2A had been derived from the removal of fifteen <span class="CHEMICAL">amino acid</span>s from the carboxy-terminal end of the intact H2A molecule, and that valine114 was its new carboxy-terminal residue. This cleavage does not occur under low ionic strength conditions, where H2A is believed to approximate a random coil; rather, it requires high ionic strength conditions similar to those under which the H2A molecule undergoes radical secondary and tertiary structural changes. This dependence upon ionic strength implies that the proteolytic cleavage is conformation- as well as sequence-specific. The H2A-specific protease is of nuclear origin, since isolation of nuclei by methods designed to maximize or minimize cytoplasmic contamination does not affect the level of proteolytic activity associated with purified chromatin. This nuclear protease appears to be tightly associated with the chromatin in vivo, for 0.6 M NaCl will not free it from isolated chromatin. A concentration of 1.2 M NaCl is required to dissociate the protease as well as its substrate from chromatin.

The effect of neurophysin-hormone interaction on the environment of the single tyrosine of bovine neurophysin (Tyr-49) and on that of the tyrosine of oxytocin and vasopressin was studied by fluorescence; tyrosine-free peptides were used to determine effects on Tyr-49, and acetylated neurophysin was used to determine effects on the hormone tyrosine. Binding increases the fluorescence intensity of Tyr-49 by 130% while the fluorescence of the hormone tyrosine is almost completely quenched. Correlation of these results with those obtained on binding oxytocin or vasopressin to native neurophysin indicates that in the hormone complexes less than half of the fluorescence of Tyr-49 is lost by Forster energy transfer to the quenched hormone tyrosine. These results support spin-label studies in indicating that the distance between Tyr-49 and the tyrosine of hormone bound to the strong hormone binding site is greater than 5 A. In the absence of peptides, the fluorescence of Tyr-49 increases by 40% on lowering the pH from 6.2 to 2. Titration of the acid fluorescence transition in bovine neurophysins-I and -II, and in bovine neurophysin-II treated with carboxypeptidase B to remove the Arg-Arg-Val sequence at the <span class="CHEMICAL">carboxyl</span> terminus, indicates that this transition is due to titration of a side-chain <span class="CHEMICAL">carboxyl</span> with an intrinsic pK of 4.6. The effects of guanidine, glycerol, and disulfide cleavage on the magnitude of the acid transition indicate that the conformational information necessary for the transition resides within the amino acid sequence adjacent to Tyr-49. Accordingly, the fluorescence acid transition is attributed to decreased quenching by Glu-46 or Glu-47 upon protonation. Glycerol is shown to perturb the glutamate-tyrosine interaction in the absence of general conformational effects.

The exchange catalyzed by the E. coli enzyme with glutamate occurs in the absence of ammonia and is partially inhibited by added NH4Cl, as expected if the exchange is in the mechanistic pathway for glutamine synthesis.

<div class='PART-OF'><table><tr><td>Rosette formation between human lymphocytes and sheep erythrocytes. Inhibition of rosette formation by specific glycopeptides. Rosette formation with unsensitized sheep erythrocytes is a characteristic of human thymus dependent lymphocytes. Release of glycopeptides from the sheep erythrocyte by trypsin reduces rosette formation. These tryptic glycopeptides inhibit rosette formation by untrypsinized sheep erythrocytes; this suggests that rosetting is mediated by erythrocyte surface glycopeptides. To investigate the molecular nature of this interaction, we examined the abilities of various model compounds to act as haptenic inhibitors of rosette formation. Inhibition is given by glycopeptides bearing oligosaccharide units rich in sialic acid, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and mannose linked to <span class="CHEMICAL">asparagine</span> residues through glycosylamine bonds. Among compounds tested, fetuin glycopeptide is most effective, but human <span class="GENE">transferrin</span> glycopeptide and human erythrocyte glycopeptide I also inhibit rosette formation. Other compounds including human erythrocyte glycopeptide II, human IgG glycopeptide, lacto-N-neotetraose, 3'- and 6'-sialyllactose show no significant inhibition. Neither sialic acid, galactose, manose, nor N-acetyl-glucosamine alone inhibits rosette formation. Stepwise degradation of fetuin glycopeptide established the galactose residues as important determinants of inhibitory activity. Fetuin glycopeptide blocks rosette formation when added to a suspension of human lymphocytes and sheep erythrocytes or when preincubated with human lymphocytes, but not when preincubated with sheep erythrocytes. Studies of the binding of [3H] fetuin glycopeptide to normal lymphocytes demonstrate 7.5 x 10(6) saturable binding sites per cell. No saturable binding of this compound to sheep erythrocyte membranes is observed. Compared to normals, lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia demonstrate decreased fetuin glycopeptide binding with a mean of 0.9 x 10(6) sites per cell. This decreased binding correlates with the impaired ability of these cells to form rosettes. The data suggest that fetuin glycopeptide inhibits rosette formation by binding to the thymus-dependent cell where competition occurs with sheep erythrocytes for specific lymphocyte surface receptors.</td></tr></table></div>

Basal lamina (BL) ensheathes each skeletal muscle fiber and passes through the synaptic cleft at the neuromuscular junction. Synaptic portions of the BL are known to play important roles in the formation, function, and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction. Here we demonstrate molecular differences between synaptic and extrasynaptic BL. We obtained antisera to immunogens that might be derived from or share determinants with muscle fiber BL, and used immunohistochemical techniques to study the binding of antibodies to rat skeletal muscle. Four antisera contained antibodies that distinguished synaptic from extrasynaptic portions of the muscle fiber's surface. They were anti-anterior lens capsule, anti-acetylcholinesterase, anti-lens capsule <span class="GENE">collagen</span>, and anti-muscle basement membrane collagen; the last two sera were selective only after antibodies binding to extrasynaptic areas had been removed by adsorption with connective tissue from endplate-free regions of muscle.

An anti-HEL primary in vitro antibody response can be obtained in either strain by stimulation with <span class="GENE">HEL</span> coupled to erythrocytes (RBC). Preimmunization with HEL-complete Freund's adjuvant-(CFA) or N-C-CFA-induced suppression of the anti-HEL PFC response to HEL-RBC in spleen cell cultures from B10 mice, whereas helper activity was demonstrated in cultures from B10.A mice similarly immunized.

The genetic nonresponsiveness of B10 mice to <span class="GENE">HEL</span> can therefore be attributed to the activation of suppressor T cells by a limited portion of the <span class="CHEMICAL">molecule</span> (e.g., N-C) which prevent the potential response directed against other epitopes on the same <span class="CHEMICAL">molecule</span> (e.g., LII).

<div class='PART-OF'><table><tr><td>Mannosyl transfer by membranes of Aspergillus niger: mannosylation of endogenous acceptors and partial analysis of the products. A smooth membrane fraction of Aspergillus niger catalyzed the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to endogenous lipid and protein acceptors. The mannolipid was acidic, as judged by diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography, and had a mobility similar to ficaprenyl phosphate on thin-layer chromatograms. Mannose transfer occurred optimally at pH 6.5 to 7.5 and required Mn(2+) for use of the protein as acceptor, but either Mn(2+) or Mg(2+) with the lipid as acceptor. Glycopeptides of the mannosylated protein ([(14)C]gly) and of an alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) secreted by the organism were produced by Pronase digestion and separation of the products on Sephadex G-25. Because <span class="GENE">ovalbumin</span> has a carbohydrate composition similar to that of alpha-glu and because the carbohydrate structure of <span class="GENE">ovalbumin</span> is known, <span class="GENE">ovalbumin</span> glycopeptides (Ov) were similarly obtained and used as standards in determining carbohydrate structures. Oligosaccharide chains of [(14)C]gly, alpha-glu, and Ov were obtained by treatment of the respective glycopeptides with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, reduction with NaBT(4), and concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography. The (3)H-labeled <span class="CHEMICAL">oligosaccharides</span> obtained were subjected to the following treatments: (i) digestion with alpha- and beta-mannosidases, (ii) Smith degradation, and (iii) acetolysis. Subsequently, changes in paper chromatographic mobilities were detected. Also, alpha-glu was permethylated, and the partially methylated alditol acetates were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. The resultant proposed structure shows that the oligosaccharide chain of alpha-glu is almost identical to that of an Ov chain, while [(14)C]gly has a structure which is probably the same as that of alpha-glu. It is suggested that the transferase(s) involved in [(14)C]gly synthesis in vitro may be responsible for glycosylation of secreted enzymes.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='PART-OF'><table><tr><td>T-lymphocyte response to cytochrome c. I. Demonstration of a T-cell heteroclitic proliferative response and identification of a topographic antigenic determinant on pigeon cytochrome c whose immune recognition requires two complementing major histocompatibility complex-linked immune response genes. The T-lymphocyte proliferative response to pigeon cytochrome c was studied in the mouse. H-2a and H-2k strains were responders to this antigen whereas H-2b, H-2d, H-2f, H-2ja, H-2p, H-2q, H-2r, H-2s, and H-2u strains were low or nonresponders. Genetic mapping demonstrated that two major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-linked Ir genes control the response, one in I-A, the other in I-E/I-C. The major antigenic determinant recognized in this response was localized by cross-stimulations with species variants and <span class="CHEMICAL">cyanogen bromide</span> cleavage fragments of cytochrome c. It was found to be a topographic surface determinant composed of an isoleucine for valine substitution at residue 3, a glutamine for lysine substitution at residue 100 and a lysine for glutamic acid substitution at residue 104. Tobacco hornworm moth cytochrome c, which contains a glutamine at residue 100 but a terminal lysine at residue 103 (one amino acid closer to the glutamine), stimulated pigeon cytochrome c immune T cells better than the immunogen. This result demonstrates for the first time a functional T-cell heteroclitic proliferative response in a system under Ir gene control. Immunization with the <span class="CHEMICAL">cyanogen bromide</span> cleavage fragments revealed that only pigeon cytochrome c fragment 81-104 was immunogenic. This fragment primed for a T-cell proliferative response whose specificity was nearly identical to that of the T-cell response primed for by the whole molecule, suggesting that the glutamine at 100 and the lysine at 104 form the immunodominant portion of the antigenic site. Furthermore, mixing experiments using the two cross-reacting antigens, hippopotamus cytochrome c and Pekin duck or <span class="GENE">chicken cytochrome c</span> fragment (81-104), each of which contains only one of the two immunodominant substitutions, demonstrated that the T lymphocytes responding to the major antigenic determinant comprise a single family of clones that recognize both amino acids as part of the same determinant. Thus, two complementing MHC-linked Ir genes can control the immune response to a single antigenic determinant.</td></tr></table></div>

Oxygen carriage and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) levels have been measured in the blood of seven species of Australian marsupials ranging in size from 35 to 0.03 kg. They were Red and Grey Kangaroos, Wallaroo, Tammar Wallaby, Brush-tailed possum, Potoroo, and Brown Marsupial Mouse. Oxygen affinity decreased with decrease in adult body size, standard P50 (at 36 C) varying from 24.6 torr in the largest (Red Kangaroo) to 41.9 torr in the smallest (Brown Marsupial Mouse). The relationship between P50 and body size is similar to the relationship which has been described previously for eutherian mammals. The Bohr factor (--deltalog P50/deltapH) and value for Hill n were generally in the range found for other land-dwelling mammals.

In the present paper, we report a considerable purification of these isozymes and describe a number of their kinetic properties. Four isozymes were isolated into 2 major forms, A1 and B1, and 2 minor forms, A2 and B2, which were similar to the respective major forms in all kinetic properties tested. Hexosaminidase B1 has a molecular weight of approximately 93,000 daltons and is inhibited by high concentrations of p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide. The inhibition is reversed by ethanol. Hexosaminidase B1 has a molecular weight of approximately 93,000 daltons and is inhibited by high concentrations of p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide. The inhibition is reversed by ethanol. Hexosaminidase A1 has a molecular weight of approximately 170,000 and is not inhibited by high concentrations of substrate. The A forms are relatively less active against p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminide than the B forms. Neither hexosaminidases A1 or B1 has any endo-beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase activity. Comparison of the properties of the 2 major isozymes suggested that measurements of activity obtained under different assay conditions could be used to quantitate the amount of each <span class="GENE">isozyme</span> in a mixture of the two.

The affinity of the reduced-alkylated molecules for target <span class="GENE">cells</span> was evaluated by their ability 1) to sensitize primate skin in a reversed P-K reaction, 2) to sensitize human basophils in a reversed-type histamine release and 3) to block passive sensitization with reaginic antibody. Antibody-epsilon0 antibody was employed for reversed type reactions to avoid participation of cell-bound normal IgE in the reactions. The sensitizing activity of IgE did not change following reduction in 1 mM DTT, which split inter-heavy-light chain <span class="CHEMICAL">disulfide</span> bond. The activity of IgE significantly diminished after reduction in 2 mM DTT followed by alkylation. This treatment resulted in the cleavage of two intra-epsilon-chain <span class="CHEMICAL">disulfide</span> bonds, which are present between the hinge and the Fd portion of the molecules. The reduced-alkylated protein was capable of sensitizing primate skin and human basophils, however, a much higher concentration of the reduced-alkylated protein than the native protein was required for passive sensitization. The optimal sensitization period for the reversed P-K reaction was 3 hr with the reduced-alkylated protein. The protein had the ability to block passive sensitization with reaginic antibody. The reduced-alkylated protein and the native protein were labeled with 125I, and binding of these proteins with human basophils was examined by autoradiography. The results showed that affinity of the reduced-alkylated protein for basophils was less than that of native protein. Since the <span class="CHEMICAL">disulfide</span> bonds split by 2 mM DTT were not included in the Fc portion of the molecules, the Fc fragment was obtained from the reduced-alkylated protein and was tested for affinity for basophils. It was found that the Fc fragment had higher affinity than the reduced-alkylated protein. Recovery of the affinity by papain digestion strongly suggested that cleavage of <span class="CHEMICAL">disulfide</span> bonds in the Fab portion of the molecules induced conformational changes in the Fc portion which is involved in binding to the target <span class="GENE">cells</span>. Reduction of IgE with 10 mM DTT followed by alkylation resulted in cleavage of 5 <span class="CHEMICAL">disulfide</span> bonds, which is accompanied by a loss of both sensitizing and blocking activities.

Phentolamine, 20 or 30 mug, or pronethalol, 20 mug (alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blockers, respectively) injected into the 3rd V failed to alter the elevation of plasma <span class="GENE">LH</span> evoked by PGE2 injected into the ventricle 10 min later. Likewise, <span class="GENE">LH</span> release following PGE2 was not changed when a dopaminergic blocker, pimozide (0.63 mg/kg, SC), was injected 2 h prior to PGE2. Two antagonists of serotonin, <span class="CHEMICAL">methysergide maleate</span> (3 mg/kg ip) or cinanserin HC1 (1 mg/kg iv) given 2 h or 45 min before PGE2, respectively, failed to alter the action of PGE2.

The results of this study indicate that the effect of PGE2 on <span class="GENE">LH</span> release is not mediated by adrenergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic, or cholinergic receptors.

The effects on GH and PRL secretion of several pharmacological agents known to modify central neurotransmitter action were determined in unanesthetized male rats. Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocker (5 mg/kg iv), abolished episodic GH secretion and caused elevation of serum PRL levels. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker (5 mg/kg iv), had no effect on GH secretion and caused a small but significant depression in PRL levels. Parachlorophenylalanine methyl ester, an inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase (300-350 mg/kg ip), resulted in significant inhibition of GH pulsatile secretion and suppressed PRL levels. <span class="CHEMICAL">methysergide hydrogen maleinate</span> (25 mg/kg iv), a <span class="GENE">serotonin receptor</span> antagonist, also inhibited GH secretion, but produced a transient stimulation in PRL levels. Atropine sulfate (2 mg/kg iv) caused significant suppression in GH secretion, but had no effect on PRL. Picrotoxin, a gamma-aminobutyric acid antagonist, in a subconvulsive dose of 1-3 mg/kg iv, also depressed GH episodic secretion but did not affect PRL levels. These results indicate that several neurotransmitters, i.e., norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid, found in high concentration in the hypothalamus, influence GH and PRL secretion.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='ANTAGONIST'><table><tr><td>Spinal adrenergic mechanisms regulating sympathetic outflow to blood vessels. The role of descending spinal catecholamine (CA)-containing fibers in cardiovascular regulation was examined. Monoamine-containing fibers were visualized by fluorescence histochemical methods at the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal segments. Two major groups of descending CA-containing axons were located in the lateral funiculus at the midcervical spinal level. At the thoracolumbar spinal segments CA-containing terminals were concentrated mostly around <span class="GENE">cells</span> of the intermediolateral nucleus. In addition a distinct CA-containing fasciculus was observed at the level of the sympathetic nucleus which appeared to course toward the opposite site of the cord. To evaluate the role of the efferent CA-containing fibers, changes in heart rate, arterial pressure, femoral blood flow, and calculated peak vascular resistance were elicited by electrical stimulation of selected sites in the midcervical spinal cord. Although changes in femoral flow and arterial pressure were evoked from many midcervical sites, there was a distinct correlation between the magnitude of peak femoral resistance elevation and density of CA-containing axons activated. Furthermore, efferent spinal vasoconstrictor outflow to the hindlimbs crosses below the cervical level. This observation is in good agreement with fluorescence microscopy studies revealing CA-containing fibers which appear to decussate. Pharmacological studies also were undertaken to evaluate transmission in spinal vasopressor pathways. In these studies alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists and agonists were perfused into the spinal subarachnoid space. Heart rate, arterial pressure, femoral flow, and femoral resistance responses elicited from efferent spinal pathways were significantly attenuated following superfusion of the spinal cord with the alpha-antagonists BE-2254 (HEAT) and <span class="CHEMICAL">phentolamine</span>. It was shown that inhibition of the centrally evoked responses was due to actions of the alpha-antagonists at a spinal locus and not due to peripheral vascular alpha-receptor blockade. Spinal perfusion with the alpha-receptor agonist norepinephrine potentiated cardiovascular responses. Likewise, loading with the norepinephrine precursor 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-dopa) enhanced vasoconstrictor responses evoked in the cross-perfused hindlimb of p-chlorophenylalanine-pretreated cats. These observations support the idea that bulbospinal CA-containing fibers relay excitatory impulses to preganglionic vasoconstrictor neurons and that spinal alpha-adrenergic receptor activation is necessary for transmission of this information.</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='ANTAGONIST'><table><tr><td>The interaction of histamine and guanylnucleotides with <span class="GENE">cardiac adenylate cyclase</span> and its relationship to cardiac contractility. Histamine stimulates adenylate cyclase activity in a washed membrane preparation from guinea-pig ventricle. Marked synergistic effects are observed with histamine and GTP. In the absence of GTP, the degree of stimulation of the enzyme by histamine is slight and occurs only in the presence of relatively high concentrations of ATP suggesting that ATP, or contaminating GTP in commercial preparations of ATP, may partially satisfy the guanylnucleotide requirement. The GTP analog, GppNHp, strongly and irreversibly activates the cardiac enzyme. Preincubation studies, in which the membranes are treated with GppNHp alone or in combination with histamine followed by estensive washing, indicate that histamine markedly increases the rate of activation of the enzyme by the guanylnucleotide. It is suggested that the mechanism of action of histamine on adenylate cyclase involves a facilitation of the interaction of guanylnucleotides with the regulatory site of the enzyme. The relative activities for stimulation of adenylate cyclase of a series of histamine analogs correlate quite well with the activities of these derivatives on four H2-receptor systems, including atrial rate and ventricular contractility and do not correlate with the activities on H1-receptors. The H2-receptor antagonists, <span class="CHEMICAL">burimamide</span> and metiamide, competitively inhibit hitamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase and the dissociation constants for these antagonists on the enzyme agree with the pharmacological data on the H2-receptors in the atria and ventricles.

Receptor blocking drugs were used to determine whether adrenergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic, or cholinergic synapses are involved in mediating the LH release induced by intraventricularly injected PGE2. Prostaglandin E2 (5mug) was injected into the 3rd ventricle (3rd V) of ovariectomized rats, and plasma LH concentrations before and after treatment were determined by radioimmunoassay. Phentolamine, 20 or 30 mug, or pronethalol, 20 mug (alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blockers, respectively) injected into the 3rd V failed to alter the elevation of plasma LH evoked by PGE2 injected into the ventricle 10 min later. Likewise, LH release following PGE2 was not changed when a dopaminergic blocker, pimozide (0.63 mg/kg, SC), was injected 2 h prior to PGE2. Two antagonists of serotonin, <span class="CHEMICAL">methysergide maleate</span> (3 mg/kg ip) or cinanserin HC1 (1 mg/kg iv) given 2 h or 45 min before PGE2, respectively, failed to alter the action of PGE2.

The results of this study indicate that the effect of PGE2 on LH release is not mediated by adrenergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic, or cholinergic receptors. They also suggest that PGE2 is not acting trans-synaptically but probably directly on the <span class="GENE">LHRH</span> neuron to induce the discharge of <span class="GENE">LHRH</span> into the hypophysial portal vessels which then evokes release of LH from the adenohypophysis.</td></tr></table></div>

The dose-response curve for the chronotropic action of phenylephrine was parallel to that of isoprenaline, whilst the dose-response curve for the inotropic action of phenylephrine was less steep than that of isoprenaline.3 The infusion of <span class="CHEMICAL">pindolol</span>, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, at a rate of 1 mug/min, shifted the isoprenaline dose-response curves to the right, and to the same extent, in both papillary muscle and sinus node preparations. In contrast to isoprenaline, the antagonism of phenylephrine by <span class="CHEMICAL">pindolol</span> was noncompetitive. Phentolamine did not affect the positive inotropic and chronotropic actions of phenylephrine.4 On isolated ventricular strips alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by 10(-6) M phentolamine did not affect dose-response curves to phenylephrine or dopamine. <span class="CHEMICAL">pindolol</span> shifted the dopamine dose-response curves to the right in a competitive manner and those of phenylephrine in a noncompetitive manner.5 On ventricular strips from reserpine-pretreated dogs phenylephrine and tyramine dose-response curves were shifted markedly to the right and downwards. Desipramine (10(-5) M) which enhanced the action of noradrenaline considerably reduced the myocardial responses of phenylephrine.6 Papaverine (10(-5) M) decreased the threshold concentration of phenylephrine required to stimulate the myocardium and shifted phenylephrine dose-response curves to the left.7 Raising the temperature from 32 degrees C to 37 degrees C shifted phenylephrine dose-response curves to the right; when the temperature was raised from 37 degrees C to 42 degrees C the affinity of the drug was not changed.8 Other alpha-adrenoceptor stimulants, methoxamine and clonidine, decreased the active tension of ventricular strips. The responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline (in the presence of pindolol; 3 x 10(-8) M) were not affected by phentolamine (10(-6) M).9 The results indicate that <span class="GENE">adrenoceptors</span> mediating positive inotropic responses in the dog ventricle are of the beta-type and that post-synaptic alpha-adrenoceptors are not involved.

<div class='ANTAGONIST'><table><tr><td>Some chemical aspects of histamine H2-receptor antagonists. Certain chemical properties, which may determine the biological actions of the recently discovered histamine H2-receptor antagonists <span class="CHEMICAL">burimamide</span> and metiamide, are identified, partly by considering the derivation of these antagonists. Examples are given of attempts to design antagonists using histamine as starting point. A partial agonist was eventually obtained through modifying the side chain of histamine but retaining the imidazole ring. Further developments led to the synthesis of uncharged thioureido analogues and to the discovery of the antagonist, <span class="CHEMICAL">burimamide</span>. Consideration of the relative concentration of imidazole tautomers led to the replacement of a methylene group (-CH2-) with an isosteric thioether (-S-) link in the side chain, and incorporation of a methyl group in the imidazole ring; these changes afforded metiamide, an orally active antagonist. These developments emphasize that the imidazole ring appears to have a special importance at <span class="GENE">h2 receptors</span>. <span class="CHEMICAL">burimamide</span> and metiamide are hydrophilic molecules that resemble histamine in having an imidazole ring but differ in the side chain which, though polar, is uncharged. By contrast, the H1-receptor antihistaminic drugs are lipophilic molecules; their resemblance to histamine is in having a positively charged ammonium side chain. These substantial chemical differences between the respective antagonists probably determine their selectivity in distinguishing between the two types of histamine receptor. Furthermore, the very low lipophilicities of these H2-receptor antagonists probably account for the lack of central nervous system and local anesthetic effects normally associated with the use of antihistaminic drugs.</td></tr></table></div>

The midpoint potential of cytochrome b6 in the fragments is close to 0V, showing a one electron transition. No cytochrome b559 was detectable, neither in difference absorption spectra nor in light-induced absorbance changes. In the absence of added cofactors only cytochrome b6 photoreduction can be observed. This photoreduction is stimulated by ferredoxin. Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase appears not to be involved in cytochrome b6 reduction. Photooxidation of cytochrome b6 is dependent on plastocyanin addition and inhibited by DBMIB, a <span class="CHEMICAL">plastoquinone</span> antagonist. Addition of plastocyanin restores cytochrome f photooxidation as well, reacting quite specifically in about equimolar concentrations to bound cytochrome f. The stimulation of cytochrome f oxidation is abolished by an antibody prepared against plastocyanin, indicating a surface location of plastocyanin in digitonin treated membranes. Biphasic kinetics of dark-reduction of cytochrome f by ascorbate indicate that part of this cytochrome f is relatively inaccessible in the membrane. After preillumination a monophasic reduction is observed and the slowly oxidized component is absent. Illumination in the presence of plastocyanin causes a fast and complete reduction of cytochrome f, suggesting equilibration of cytochrome f with added plastocyanin, residing in the membrane surface. It appears that actinic light causes conformation and/or structural changes in the membrane of these digitonin fragments, influencing cytochrome f asseccibility.</td></tr></table></div>

(-)-Norepinephrine and other catecholamines inhibit basal and prostaglandin E1-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities by 35 to 60% in homogenates of NG108-15 neuroblastoma x gloma hybrid cells and markedly reduce adenosine 3'35:'-monophosphate levels of intact cells, but do not affect guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate levels. The specificity of the NG108-15 receptor for ligands is that of an alpha receptor, possibly a presynaptic alpha 2 receptor. The inhibition of adenylate cyclase by norepinephrine is reversed by alpha receptor antagonists such as dihydroergotamine or phentolamine, but not by the <span class="GENE">beta receptor</span> antagonist <span class="CHEMICAL">propranolol</span>. The effect of norepinephrine on adenylate cyclase activity initially is dependent on GTP; half-maximal inhibition of enzyme activity by norepinephrine is obtained with 0.2 micron GTP. The inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by norepinephrine is reduced by 10 mM NaF and is abolished by 0.05 mM guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate. Inhibitions of NG108-15 adenylate cyclase mediated by alpha receptors, opiate receptors, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are not additive; this suggests that the three species of receptors can be functionally coupled to the same adenylate cyclase molecules or molecules regulating the enzyme.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='ANTAGONIST'><table><tr><td>Catecholamine and guanine nucleotide activation of <span class="GENE">skeletal muscle adenylate cyclase</span>. Activation of adenylate cyclase by guanine nucleotide and catecholamines was examined in plasma membranes prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle. The GTP analog, 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate caused a time and temperature-dependent activation of the enzyme which was persistent, the Ka was 0.05 microM. 5'-Guanylyl imidodiphosphate binding to the membranes was time and temperature dependent, KD 0.07 microM. Beta adrenergic amines accelerated the rate of 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate activation of the enzyme with an order of potency isoproterenol approximately soterenol approximately salbutamol greater than epinephrine greater than norephrine. Catecholamine activation was antagonized by propranolol and the beta2 antagonist butoxamine; the beta1 antagonist practolol was inactive. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol bound to the membranes and binding was antagonized by beta adrenergic agonists with an order of potency similar to the activation of adenylate cyclase and was antagonized by <span class="CHEMICAL">butoxamine</span> but not by practolol. The data are consistent with the idea that adenylate cyclase in skeletal muscle plasma membranes is coupled to adrenergic receptors of the beta2 type.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='ANTAGONIST'><table><tr><td>Evidence for a physiological role of renal sympathetic nerves in adrenergic stimulation of renin release in the rat. Previous studies on renin release by an in vitro system of rat kidney slices, which is devoid of hemodynamic influences, have provided evidence that renin release is stimulated by a beta-adrenergic mechanism. We used this system to study effects of tyramine (an indirectly acting amine capable of displacing endogenous catecholmines from sympathetic nerve endings) on renin release. Tyramine (10(-3)M) in the presence of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (pheniprazine, 10(-5)M) and a <span class="GENE">phosphodiesterase</span> inhibitor (theophylline, 10(-3)M) significantly (P less than 0.01) stimulated renin release when values were compared to control observations for media containing only the inhibitors. Tyramine-induced stimulation of renin release was blocked by the beta-blocking agent, propranolol (2 X 10(-4) M), and the neural uptake blocking agent, cocaine (10(-5) M), but not by the alpha-antagonist, <span class="CHEMICAL">phentolamine</span> (9 X 10(-4) M). These observations demonstrate a potential role for the sympathetic innervation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus on renin release.</td></tr></table></div>

A common feature is the presence of a conjugated triene, and the name "leukotriene" has been introduced to designate these compounds. Leukotriene A (5,6-epoxy-7,9,11,14-icosatetraenoic acid) is an intermediate in the formation of leukotriene B (5,12-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-icosatetraenoic acid) and is proposed to be a precursor also of leukotriene C, which is the <span class="GENE">SRS</span> identified here.</td></tr></table></div>

The different effects of prostaglandin synthetase stimulators on inhibition of the <span class="GENE">cyclooxygenase</span> by structurally distinct classes of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents suggest that the enzyme is altered by interaction with these stimulators. Reversible stimulation of prostaglandin synthetase activity by phenols and some other compounds and the relative influence of these stimulators on inhibitors of the <span class="GENE">cyclooxygenase</span> were determined quantitatively. Two distinct classes of inhibitors were established. The fenamates were relatively weak inhibitors alone but were much more potent in the presence of phenolic compounds. In contrast, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and flurbiprofen were more potent than the fenamates and were reduced in effectiveness by the stimulators, as expected on the basis of two opposing actions. The relative potency of the <span class="GENE">cyclooxygenase</span> stimulators (phenol greater than norepinephrine greater than tryptophan greater than benzoquinone greater than anisole) paralleled their synergistic action on the fenamates and their antagonist action on the <span class="CHEMICAL">nonfenamates</span>. This correlation suggests that an enzyme alteration which leads to <span class="GENE">cyclooxygenase</span> stimulation may also result in increased sensitivity to fenamates and decreased sensitivity to the other inhibitors, possibly by altering their capacity to bind.</td></tr></table></div>

Since <span class="CHEMICAL">sotalol</span>, 1-INPEA (specific beta-adrenoceptor antagonists devoid of local anaesthetic activity); practolol and metoprolol (selective cardiac beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists) enhanced hypoglycaemic action of insulin and H 35/25 (a selective beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonist) failed to affect it, it seems that selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade (similar to cardiac beta-1 adrenoceptors) mediates enhancement of insulin hypoglycaemia. Caution should, therefore, be exercised in administering beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and insulin together. A reduction in the dose of insulin may be necessary.</td></tr></table></div>

Chemical alterations of the aminoacid chain have revealed its importance in the shaping of the pharmacological effects. The drug is rapidly absorbed. Amineptine is metabolised principally by beta-hydroxylation of the chain. The pharmacological profile at different doses is as follows: a. 0.1 mg/kg: reduction of exploratory behaviour, b. 1 mg/kg: reduction of serum prolactin level, c. 5 mg/kg: potentiation of L-5 HTP, d. 10 mg/kg: antagonism of the effects of reserpine and of <span class="CHEMICAL">tetrabenazine</span>, e. increased activity and social behaviour, EEG alerting effect limited to 1 hour and increase in paradoxical sleep (15 to 20 mg/kg). This pharmacological profile suggests an effect of amineptine upon certain dopamine structures. At synapse, neurobiochemistry confirms a mechanism of inhibition of DA incorporation and inhibition of uptake and/or release of 5 <span class="GENE">HT</span>. Amineptine is virtually devoid of peripheral activity, particularly anticholinergic Amineptine may be indicated for the treatment of depression where retardation is dominant.</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='ANTAGONIST'><table><tr><td>The effects of the <span class="GENE">H1</span> and H2 antihistamines on "allergic" histamine release and its inhibition by histamine. Antigen-induced, IgE-mediated release of histamine from human basophiles is an in vitro model of allergic reacttions; it is blocked by extracellular histamine, presumably as a result of its ability to increase adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) levels. The <span class="GENE">H1</span> antihistamines do not antagonize these effects of histamine but at approximately equal to 1 mM cause histamine release and at approximately equal to 0.1mM inhibit antigen-induced histamine release. The <span class="CHEMICAL">phenothiazine</span> antihistamines are 10-30 fold more potent inhibitors than the rest; other tricyclic antidepressant drugs share this activity. The mechanism of this inhibition, which occurs in both the 1 degree and 2 degree stages of histamine release, is not known but it is not due to partial agonist activity since the anti-H1 drugs cause a significant fall in cyclic AMP levels. The anti-anaphylactic effects of the <span class="GENE">H1</span> antagonists probably play no therapeutic role but we suggest that drugs structurally similar to the <span class="CHEMICAL">phenothiazine</span> antihistamines should be developed for clinical testing. The H2 antihistamines block histamine-induced inhibition of histamine release and the increase in cyclic AMP levels, but neither cause nor inhibit histamine release.

<div class='ANTAGONIST'><table><tr><td>[Isolation, purification and characterization of regulatory properties of adenylate cyclase from rabbit heart]. Rabbit heart membranes possessing the adenylate cyclase activity were isolated and purified by extraction with high ionic strength solutions and centrifugation in the sucrose density gradient. It was shown that the membranes are characterized by a high percentage of cholesterol (molar ratio cholesterol/phospholipids is 0.24) and an increased activity of Na, K-ATPase, which suggests the localization of adenylate cyclase in the sarcolemma. During centrifugation in the sucrose density gradient the activities of andenylate cyclase and Na,K-ATPase are not separated. Treatment of heart sarcolemma with a 0.3% solution of lubrol WX results in 10--20% solubilization of adenylate cyclase. Purification of the enzyme in the membrane fraction is accompanied by a decrease in the activity of phosphodiesterase; however, about 2% of the heart diesterase total activity cannot be removed from the sarcolemma even after its treatment with 0.3% lubrol WX. Epinephrine and NaF activate adenylate cyclase without changing the pH dependence of the enzyme. The alpha-adrenergic antagonist <span class="CHEMICAL">phentolamine</span> has no effect on the adenylate cyclase activation by catecholamines, glucagon and histamine; the beta-adrenergic antagonist alprenolol competitively inhibits the effects of isoproterenol, epinephrine and norepinephrine, having no effect on the enzyme activation by glucagon and histamine. There is no competition between epinephrine, glucagon and histamine for the binding site of the hormone; however, there may occur a competition between the <span class="GENE">hormone receptors</span> for the binding to the enzyme. A combined action of several hormones on the membranes results in the averaging of their individual activating effects. When the hormones were added one after another, the extent of adenylate cyclase activation corresponded to that induced by the first hormone; the activation was insensitive to the effect of the second hormone added. It is assumed that the outer membrane of myocardium cells contains a adenylate cyclase and three types of receptors, each being capable to interact with the same form of enzyme. The activity of adenylate cyclase is determined by the type of the receptor, to which it is bound and by the amount of the enzyme-receptor complex.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='ANTAGONIST'><table><tr><td>Modulation of cellular-immune responses in vivo and in vitro by histamine receptor-bearing lymphocytes. Histamine, one of the mediators involved in the IgE-mediated reaction, was demonstrated to influence in vivo and in vitro components of cellular-immune reactions in orthochlorbenzoyl-bovine gamma globulin-immune guinea pigs. 10(-3) M histamine reduced by half the size of a delayed hypersensitivity skin test at 24 h. Inhibition of skin reactivity by histamine could be partially reversed by H-1 receptor antagonists such as chlorpheniramine and completely prevented by <span class="GENE">h-2 receptor</span> antagonists such as <span class="CHEMICAL">burimamide</span>. The histamine suppression of cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity could be accounted for in part by its inhibitory effect on certain lymphocyte responses including antigen-induced migration inhibitory factor (MIF) production and proliferation. At concentrations of 10(-3)-10(-5) M histamine reversibly inhibited MIF production and its action could be blocked by H-2 antagonists but not H-1 antagonists. Thus, lymphocytes bearing <span class="GENE">h-2 receptor</span>s modulate MIF production and probably lymphocyte proliferation as well. Histamine did not interfere with the macrophage response to preformed MIF.

The effect of norepinephrine on adenylate cyclase activity initially is dependent on GTP; half-maximal inhibition of enzyme activity by norepinephrine is obtained with 0.2 micron GTP. The inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by norepinephrine is reduced by 10 mM NaF and is abolished by 0.05 mM guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate. Inhibitions of NG108-15 adenylate cyclase mediated by <span class="GENE">alpha receptor</span>s, opiate receptors, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are not additive; this suggests that the three species of receptors can be functionally coupled to the same adenylate cyclase molecules or molecules regulating the enzyme.</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='ANTAGONIST'><table><tr><td>Beta-adrenergic potentiation of the increased in vitro accumulation of cycloleucine by rat thymocytes induced by triiodothyronine. We have previously demonstrated that 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T(3)), whether administered in vivo or added to suspending media in vitro, promptly stimulates the in vitro accumulation of the nonmetabolized amino acids, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, and cycloleucine (CLE) by thymocytes isolated from weanling rats. In these studies, we have examined the in vitro interaction between catecholamines and T(3) with respect to this effect. The previously reported enhancement of CLE accumulation in thymocytes by T(3) in vitro (1 muM) was confirmed. When added alone in concentrations ranging between 10 nM and 0.1 mM, the adrenergic agonists, epinephrine and norepinephrine, had no effect on CLE accumulation. At a concentration of 1 muM, isoproterenol, terbutaline, and phenylephrine were also without effect. However, the effect of T(3) was clearly potentiated by the concomitant addition of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and possibly isoproterenol, whereas terbutaline and phenylephrine were without effect. Neither basal nor T(3)-enhanced CLE accumulation was affected by the addition alone of the adrenergic blocking agents, propranolol (0.1 mM), phentolamine (10 muM), or practolol (0.1 mM). Nevertheless, the beta(1)- and beta(2)-antagonist, <span class="CHEMICAL">propranol</span>, and the beta(1)-antagonist, practolol, blocked the increment in CLE accumulation produced by epinephrine; the alpha-antagonist, phentolamine, was without effect. The enhancement of CLE accumulation that occurred in the presence of T(3), with or without epinephrine, was seen to be a result of an inhibition of CLE efflux, because T(3) alone inhibited CLE efflux, and this effect was increased when epinephrine was also present. On the other hand, neither T(3) alone nor T(3) plus epinephrine appreciably altered the rate of inward transport of CLE. As judged from studies of the ability of thymocytes to exclude trypan blue, neither T(3) alone nor T(3) plus epinephrine either enhanced or impaired viability of cells during 3-h periods of incubation. <span class="GENE">cell</span> water content, measured with [(3)H]urea, was unaffected by T(3), either alone or in the presence of epinephrine. In confirmation of previous results, the stimulatory effect of T(3) on CLE accumulation was unaffected by concentrations of puromycin sufficient to inhibit protein synthesis by at least 95%, and the potentiating action of epinephrine on the response to T(3) was similarly unaffected. From these findings, it is concluded that the effect of T(3) to increase CLE accumulation by thymocytes in vitro, though itself independent of adrenergic mediation, is potentiated by beta(1)-adrenergic stimulation. This interaction appears distinctly different from other thyroid hormone-catecholamine interactions, in which thyroid hormones enhance physiological responses to catecholamines. Its mechanism remains unclear, but the properties of the T(3) effect, and possibly the interaction itself, suggest that T(3) enhances CLE accumulation by an action at the level of the <span class="GENE">cell</span> membrane.</td></tr></table></div>

Comparison of rotation data from experiments at intact <span class="GENE">dopamine receptor</span>s with those from experiments at supersensitive <span class="GENE">dopamine receptor</span>s revealed: (1) A marked decrease of the threshold dose for induction of rotational behaviour in the 6-OHDA lesioned rats.

The antiparkinsonian activity of bromocriptine and of <span class="CHEMICAL">lergotrile</span> was investigated in monkeys with surgically induced tremor and in parkinsonian patients. Both drugs effectively relieve tremor in experimental monkeys and induce less pronounced abnormal involuntary movements than L-dopa or piribedil. Both drugs were shown to be of therapeutic value in a group of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who were no longer responsive to levodopa combined with carbidopa. Adverse effects were similar to those observed with levodopa and carbidopa, except that in individual patients abnormal involuntary movements and diurnal oscillations in performance ("on-off" effect) were decreased, while mental changes were increased.

Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocker (5 mg/kg iv), abolished episodic GH secretion and caused elevation of serum PRL levels. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker (5 mg/kg iv), had no effect on GH secretion and caused a small but significant depression in PRL levels. <span class="CHEMICAL">parachlorophenylalanine methyl ester</span>, an inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase (300-350 mg/kg ip), resulted in significant inhibition of GH pulsatile secretion and suppressed PRL levels.

Atropine sulfate (2 mg/kg iv) caused significant suppression in GH secretion, but had no effect on PRL. Picrotoxin, a gamma-aminobutyric acid antagonist, in a subconvulsive dose of 1-3 mg/kg iv, also depressed GH episodic secretion but did not affect PRL levels.

Histamine H-2 receptors are thought to mediate gastric acid secretory responses, whereas <span class="GENE">H-1</span> receptors supposedly regulate mucosal vascular responses to histamine. In an in vivo chambered canine stomach flap preparation, the <span class="GENE">H-1</span> receptor antagonist, <span class="CHEMICAL">tripelennamine</span>, injected intraarterially (22.1 mumol/kg) into the stomach flap reduced histamine-stimulated (1.25 micron/kg/min intravenously) acid secretion by approximately two thirds with a secondary reduction in gastric mucosal blood flow. This antisecretory action does not appear to be due to nonspecific mucosal damage. The H-2 receptor antagonist, metiamide, injected intraarterially (2.5 mumol/kg) also inhibited gastric acid secretion by about two thirds as did intravenously injected metiamide (4.5 mumol/kg), whereas intravenously administered <span class="CHEMICAL">tripelennamine</span> (40.8 mumol/kg) was ineffective as an acid secretory inhibitor.

Prostaglandin E2 (5mug) was injected into the 3rd ventricle (3rd V) of ovariectomized rats, and plasma LH concentrations before and after treatment were determined by radioimmunoassay. Phentolamine, 20 or 30 mug, or pronethalol, 20 mug (alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blockers, respectively) injected into the 3rd V failed to alter the elevation of plasma LH evoked by PGE2 injected into the ventricle 10 min later. Likewise, LH release following PGE2 was not changed when a dopaminergic blocker, pimozide (0.63 mg/kg, SC), was injected 2 h prior to PGE2. Two antagonists of serotonin, methysergide maleate (3 mg/kg ip) or <span class="CHEMICAL">cinanserin hc1</span> (1 mg/kg iv) given 2 h or 45 min before PGE2, respectively, failed to alter the action of PGE2. Atropine (100 or 250 mug) injected into the 3rd V 10 min prior to PGE2 was also ineffective in blocking the increase in plasma LH following PGE2. The results of this study indicate that the effect of PGE2 on LH release is not mediated by adrenergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic, or cholinergic receptors. They also suggest that PGE2 is not acting trans-synaptically but probably directly on the <span class="GENE">LHRH</span> neuron to induce the discharge of <span class="GENE">LHRH</span> into the hypophysial portal vessels which then evokes release of LH from the adenohypophysis.</td></tr></table></div>

There was a gradient in the responsiveness of the longitudinal muscle of the ileum; in the proximal ileum it was usually unresponsive, whereas in the distal ileum about 30% of the amplitude of contraction was caused by a direct effect on the muscle. In the circular muscle from all parts of the ileum, direct effects on the muscle were weak or absent. In the distal colon, the circular muscle was almost always unresponsive to direct effects of 5-HT even when concentrations of 5-HT as great as 100 mug/ml were used. All direct actions of 5-HT on intestinal muscle were blocked by methysergide (1 mug/ml), which itself did not affect nerve-mediated responses.3 Excitatory cholinergic nerves and excitatory and inhibitory nerves which released unidentified substances were all stimulated by 5-HT. The contractions mediated through cholinergic nerves were blocked by hyoscine (0.6 mug/ml).4 Tachyphylaxis to the action of 5-HT occurred both for effects mediated through nerves and for direct effects on the muscle. Responses returned promptly after 5-HT was washed from the organ bath.5 While 5-HT blocked its own action on neural receptors, it did not antagonize the stimulation of <span class="GENE">nicotinic receptor</span>s on cholinergic neurones by 1-1 dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP). Moreover, pentolinium markedly reduced contractions caused by DMPP without significantly affecting responses to 5-HT.

Histamine was infused intra-arterially (10-40 mug/min) into isolated blood perfused canine kidneys while functional and hemodynamic parameters were monitored. When perfusion pressure (PP) was kept constant during the infusion of histamine, renal blood flow (RBF) increased from 137 +/- 9 to 181 +/- 9 ml/min (P less than .001). A greater increase in RBF occurred to the inner renal cortex than the outer renal cortex as measured by radioactive microspheres. The fractional outer/inner cortical blood flow changed from 79:21 before histamine to 74:26 during its infusion (P less than .001). Histamine did not alter creatinine clearance (Ccr), urine volume (V), sodium excretion (UNaV) or the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) or water (FEH20) under these conditions. When renal blood flow was held constant during the infusion of histamine, PP decreased from 126/106 +/- 2 to 100/81 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than .001). This resulted in a reduction of absolute outer cortical (outer/inner) changed from 77:23 before histamine to 72:28 during its infusion (P less than .001).

<div class='ANTAGONIST'><table><tr><td>The selective eosinophil chemotactic activity of histamine. Histamine diphosphate was shown to selectively attract human eosinophils from mixed granulocyte populations when over 20% eosinophils were used in a modified Boyden chamber chemotactic assay system. This effect of histamine is abolished by incubation with diamine oxidase (histaminase) and was generated by decarboxylation of L-histidine. A linear dose dependent increase in eosinophil migration was observed between 3 X 10(-7) M and 1.25 X 10(-6) M, while higher concentrations of histamine inhibited the migration of eosinophils. The attractant activity of histamine was not inhibited by H-1 or <span class="GENE">h-2 receptor</span> antagonists, however, the inhibition of migration observed at higher histamine concentrations was reversed by <span class="CHEMICAL">metiamine</span>, an <span class="GENE">h-2 receptor</span> antagonist. The effects of histamine upon eosinophil migration were demonstrable using three different assays: (a) counting cells that had traversed 5-mum pore, 12-mum thick polycarbonate filters, (b) counting cells that had migrated various distances into a 3-mum pore, 145-mum cellulose nitrate filters, or (c) measuring the number of cells that had traversed an upper polycarbonate filter and migrated into a lower cellulose nitrate filter using 15Cr-labeled cells. The ability of histamine to enhance eosinophil migration was shown to be dependent upon the presence of a concentration gradient; histamine did not cause a dose-dependent increase in random motility. Furthermore, preincubation of the eosinophils with histamine deactivate the cells to further stimulation by histamine or by C5a. It is concluded that in low doses histamine is a chemoattractant for human eosinophils, while in higher doses histamine inhibits eosinophil migration. These observations may relate to the influx and localization of eosinophils in immediate hypersensitivity reactions.</td></tr></table></div>

Differences in NE and DA depletion following tyrosine hydroxylase inhibition with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine indicated that (+)-dexclamol and droperidol increased DA turnover with no effect on NE turnover. At a higher dose both (+)-dexclamol and droperidol, but not (-)-dexclamol, accelerated DA turnover and also that of NE. A decrease in DA concentration occurred after both drugs under the latter condition only. (+)-Dexclamol, (+/-)-dexclamol and droperidol exhibited a similar onset of action employing striatal homovanillic acid (HVA) increase as indicative of DA turnover changes. The duration of action of droperidol was shorter than for (+)-dexclamol and (+/-)-dexclamol; fluphenazine displayed a slower onset and longer duration of activity. The (-)-dexclamol was ineffective. (+)-Dexclamol, droperidol and phentolamine reduced the concentrations of 3H-NE in heart when given after the 3H-NE, a probable indication of increased NE release due to adrenergic receptor blockade.

No cytochrome b559 was detectable, neither in difference absorption spectra nor in light-induced absorbance changes. In the absence of added cofactors only cytochrome b6 photoreduction can be observed. This photoreduction is stimulated by ferredoxin. Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase appears not to be involved in cytochrome b6 reduction. Photooxidation of cytochrome b6 is dependent on plastocyanin addition and inhibited by DBMIB, a <span class="CHEMICAL">plastoquinone</span> antagonist. Addition of plastocyanin restores cytochrome f photooxidation as well, reacting quite specifically in about equimolar concentrations to bound cytochrome f. The stimulation of cytochrome f oxidation is abolished by an antibody prepared against plastocyanin, indicating a surface location of plastocyanin in digitonin treated membranes. Biphasic kinetics of dark-reduction of cytochrome f by ascorbate indicate that part of this cytochrome f is relatively inaccessible in the membrane. After preillumination a monophasic reduction is observed and the slowly oxidized component is absent. Illumination in the presence of plastocyanin causes a fast and complete reduction of cytochrome f, suggesting equilibration of cytochrome f with added plastocyanin, residing in the membrane surface. It appears that actinic light causes conformation and/or structural changes in the membrane of these digitonin fragments, influencing cytochrome f asseccibility.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='ANTAGONIST'><table><tr><td>[Isolation, purification and characterization of regulatory properties of adenylate cyclase from rabbit heart]. Rabbit heart membranes possessing the adenylate cyclase activity were isolated and purified by extraction with high ionic strength solutions and centrifugation in the sucrose density gradient. It was shown that the membranes are characterized by a high percentage of cholesterol (molar ratio cholesterol/phospholipids is 0.24) and an increased activity of Na, K-ATPase, which suggests the localization of adenylate cyclase in the sarcolemma. During centrifugation in the sucrose density gradient the activities of andenylate cyclase and Na,K-ATPase are not separated. Treatment of heart sarcolemma with a 0.3% solution of lubrol WX results in 10--20% solubilization of adenylate cyclase. Purification of the enzyme in the membrane fraction is accompanied by a decrease in the activity of phosphodiesterase; however, about 2% of the heart diesterase total activity cannot be removed from the sarcolemma even after its treatment with 0.3% lubrol WX. Epinephrine and NaF activate adenylate cyclase without changing the pH dependence of the enzyme. The alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine has no effect on the adenylate cyclase activation by catecholamines, glucagon and histamine; the beta-adrenergic antagonist <span class="CHEMICAL">alprenolol</span> competitively inhibits the effects of isoproterenol, epinephrine and norepinephrine, having no effect on the enzyme activation by glucagon and histamine. There is no competition between epinephrine, glucagon and histamine for the binding site of the hormone; however, there may occur a competition between the hormone receptors for the binding to the enzyme. A combined action of several hormones on the membranes results in the averaging of their individual activating effects. When the hormones were added one after another, the extent of adenylate cyclase activation corresponded to that induced by the first hormone; the activation was insensitive to the effect of the second hormone added. It is assumed that the outer membrane of myocardium <span class="GENE">cells</span> contains a adenylate cyclase and three types of receptors, each being capable to interact with the same form of enzyme. The activity of adenylate cyclase is determined by the type of the receptor, to which it is bound and by the amount of the enzyme-receptor complex.</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='ANTAGONIST'><table><tr><td>The effect of <span class="GENE">growth hormone</span> on the metabolism of a tryptophan load in the liver and brain of hypophysectomized rats. <span class="GENE">growth hormone</span> antagonizes the induction of tryptophan pyrrolase and tyrosine amino-transferase by <span class="CHEMICAL">cortisol</span>. We have shown that contrary to previous reports, <span class="GENE">growth hormone</span> is also capable of antagonizing the induction of these enzymes by tryptophan and alpha-methyl tryptophan. As alpha-methyl tryptophan is not metabolized appreciably in the rat, our data show that <span class="GENE">growth hormone</span> does not act indirectly through changes in the liver tryptophan content as was suggested previously. <span class="GENE">growth hormone</span> decreases the rate of tryptophan catabolism in vivo after induction of tryptophan pyrrolase by tryptophan and alpha-methyl tryptophan. Because the rate of catabolism of a tryptophan is slower in animals treated with <span class="GENE">growth hormone</span>, tissue tryptophan levels and the rate of synthesis of 5-hydroxyltryptamine in the brain are higher in these animals than in those receiving tryptophan alone. Thus, although tryptophan administration raises brain 5-hydroxytryptamine levels, induction of tryptophan pyrrolase in the liver, by the load, limits the extent and duration of the rise in brain 5-hydroxytryptamine synthesis. This has important implications for the clinical use of tryptophan in psychiatric disorders, where tryptophan is given to produce long-lasting elevations of brain 5-hydroxytryptamine.</td></tr></table></div>

However, with 2--4 mg/kg doses, the maximum effect of BOL was larger than that of LSD. LSD and BOL antagonized the apomorphine-induced decrease of DOPA accumulation, without affecting the haloperidol-induced increase.

<div class='ANTAGONIST'><table><tr><td>Spinal adrenergic mechanisms regulating sympathetic outflow to blood vessels. The role of descending spinal catecholamine (CA)-containing fibers in cardiovascular regulation was examined. Monoamine-containing fibers were visualized by fluorescence histochemical methods at the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal segments. Two major groups of descending CA-containing axons were located in the lateral funiculus at the midcervical spinal level. At the thoracolumbar spinal segments CA-containing terminals were concentrated mostly around <span class="GENE">cells</span> of the intermediolateral nucleus. In addition a distinct CA-containing fasciculus was observed at the level of the sympathetic nucleus which appeared to course toward the opposite site of the cord. To evaluate the role of the efferent CA-containing fibers, changes in heart rate, arterial pressure, femoral blood flow, and calculated peak vascular resistance were elicited by electrical stimulation of selected sites in the midcervical spinal cord. Although changes in femoral flow and arterial pressure were evoked from many midcervical sites, there was a distinct correlation between the magnitude of peak femoral resistance elevation and density of CA-containing axons activated. Furthermore, efferent spinal vasoconstrictor outflow to the hindlimbs crosses below the cervical level. This observation is in good agreement with fluorescence microscopy studies revealing CA-containing fibers which appear to decussate. Pharmacological studies also were undertaken to evaluate transmission in spinal vasopressor pathways. In these studies alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists and agonists were perfused into the spinal subarachnoid space. Heart rate, arterial pressure, femoral flow, and femoral resistance responses elicited from efferent spinal pathways were significantly attenuated following superfusion of the spinal cord with the alpha-antagonists <span class="CHEMICAL">BE-2254</span> (HEAT) and phentolamine. It was shown that inhibition of the centrally evoked responses was due to actions of the alpha-antagonists at a spinal locus and not due to peripheral vascular alpha-receptor blockade. Spinal perfusion with the alpha-receptor agonist norepinephrine potentiated cardiovascular responses. Likewise, loading with the norepinephrine precursor 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-dopa) enhanced vasoconstrictor responses evoked in the cross-perfused hindlimb of p-chlorophenylalanine-pretreated cats. These observations support the idea that bulbospinal CA-containing fibers relay excitatory impulses to preganglionic vasoconstrictor neurons and that spinal alpha-adrenergic receptor activation is necessary for transmission of this information.</td></tr></table></div>

A <span class="GENE">phosphodiesterase</span> inhibitor, 3-isobutyl methylxanthine (IBMX), stimulated IF secretion nearly fourfold while increasing tissue levels of both cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP (cGMP). Peak IF secretion in response to IBMX was not reached until after tissue cAMP levels were maximal. Dibutyryl cAMP and 8-Br-cAMP increased secretion by the same order of magnitude as did IBMX, whereas corresponding analogues of cGMP had no such effect. Histamine increased secretion of IF.

<div class='ANTAGONIST'><table><tr><td>Beta-adrenergic potentiation of the increased in vitro accumulation of cycloleucine by rat thymocytes induced by triiodothyronine. We have previously demonstrated that 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T(3)), whether administered in vivo or added to suspending media in vitro, promptly stimulates the in vitro accumulation of the nonmetabolized amino acids, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, and cycloleucine (CLE) by thymocytes isolated from weanling rats. In these studies, we have examined the in vitro interaction between catecholamines and T(3) with respect to this effect. The previously reported enhancement of <span class="GENE">CLE</span> accumulation in thymocytes by T(3) in vitro (1 muM) was confirmed. When added alone in concentrations ranging between 10 nM and 0.1 mM, the adrenergic agonists, epinephrine and norepinephrine, had no effect on <span class="GENE">CLE</span> accumulation. At a concentration of 1 muM, isoproterenol, terbutaline, and phenylephrine were also without effect. However, the effect of T(3) was clearly potentiated by the concomitant addition of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and possibly isoproterenol, whereas terbutaline and phenylephrine were without effect. Neither basal nor T(3)-enhanced <span class="GENE">CLE</span> accumulation was affected by the addition alone of the adrenergic blocking agents, propranolol (0.1 mM), phentolamine (10 muM), or practolol (0.1 mM). Nevertheless, the beta(1)- and beta(2)-antagonist, <span class="CHEMICAL">propranol</span>, and the beta(1)-antagonist, practolol, blocked the increment in <span class="GENE">CLE</span> accumulation produced by epinephrine; the alpha-antagonist, phentolamine, was without effect. The enhancement of <span class="GENE">CLE</span> accumulation that occurred in the presence of T(3), with or without epinephrine, was seen to be a result of an inhibition of <span class="GENE">CLE</span> efflux, because T(3) alone inhibited <span class="GENE">CLE</span> efflux, and this effect was increased when epinephrine was also present. On the other hand, neither T(3) alone nor T(3) plus epinephrine appreciably altered the rate of inward transport of <span class="GENE">CLE</span>. As judged from studies of the ability of thymocytes to exclude trypan blue, neither T(3) alone nor T(3) plus epinephrine either enhanced or impaired viability of cells during 3-h periods of incubation. Cell water content, measured with [(3)H]urea, was unaffected by T(3), either alone or in the presence of epinephrine. In confirmation of previous results, the stimulatory effect of T(3) on <span class="GENE">CLE</span> accumulation was unaffected by concentrations of puromycin sufficient to inhibit protein synthesis by at least 95%, and the potentiating action of epinephrine on the response to T(3) was similarly unaffected. From these findings, it is concluded that the effect of T(3) to increase <span class="GENE">CLE</span> accumulation by thymocytes in vitro, though itself independent of adrenergic mediation, is potentiated by beta(1)-adrenergic stimulation. This interaction appears distinctly different from other thyroid hormone-catecholamine interactions, in which thyroid hormones enhance physiological responses to catecholamines. Its mechanism remains unclear, but the properties of the T(3) effect, and possibly the interaction itself, suggest that T(3) enhances <span class="GENE">CLE</span> accumulation by an action at the level of the cell membrane.</td></tr></table></div>

In certain models for inflammation, particularly rat paw edema induced by compound 48/80, burimamide in combination with the H1-receptor antagonist <span class="CHEMICAL">mepyramine</span> shows anti-inflammatory activity. This may, in part, be associated with the catecholamine-releasing properties of the compound. Metiamide is less active in this respect.</td></tr></table></div>

<div class='ANTAGONIST'><table><tr><td>Some chemical aspects of histamine H2-receptor antagonists. Certain chemical properties, which may determine the biological actions of the recently discovered histamine H2-receptor antagonists burimamide and <span class="CHEMICAL">metiamide</span>, are identified, partly by considering the derivation of these antagonists. Examples are given of attempts to design antagonists using histamine as starting point. A partial agonist was eventually obtained through modifying the side chain of histamine but retaining the imidazole ring. Further developments led to the synthesis of uncharged thioureido analogues and to the discovery of the antagonist, burimamide. Consideration of the relative concentration of imidazole tautomers led to the replacement of a methylene group (-CH2-) with an isosteric thioether (-S-) link in the side chain, and incorporation of a methyl group in the imidazole ring; these changes afforded <span class="CHEMICAL">metiamide</span>, an orally active antagonist. These developments emphasize that the imidazole ring appears to have a special importance at H2 receptors. Burimamide and <span class="CHEMICAL">metiamide</span> are hydrophilic molecules that resemble histamine in having an imidazole ring but differ in the side chain which, though polar, is uncharged. By contrast, the H1-receptor antihistaminic drugs are lipophilic molecules; their resemblance to histamine is in having a positively charged ammonium side chain. These substantial chemical differences between the respective antagonists probably determine their selectivity in distinguishing between the two types of <span class="GENE">histamine receptor</span>. Furthermore, the very low lipophilicities of these H2-receptor antagonists probably account for the lack of central nervous system and local anesthetic effects normally associated with the use of antihistaminic drugs.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='ANTAGONIST'><table><tr><td>Enhancement of insulin hypoglycaemia by beta adrenoceptor antagonists. Interaction of insulin with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was studied in conscious rabbits. <span class="CHEMICAL">propranolol</span> and metoprolol did not modify the peak of insulin hypoglycaemia but delayed its recovery. Practolol, sotalol and 1-INPEA enhanced the peak effect and delayed the recovery of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. H 35/25 and d-INPEA did not modify insulin hypoglycaemia. The beta-blockers did not produce significant hypoglycaemia per se. Since sotalol, 1-INPEA (specific beta-adrenoceptor antagonists devoid of local anaesthetic activity); practolol and metoprolol (selective cardiac beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists) enhanced hypoglycaemic action of insulin and H 35/25 (a selective <span class="GENE">beta-2 adrenoceptor</span> antagonist) failed to affect it, it seems that selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade (similar to cardiac beta-1 adrenoceptors) mediates enhancement of insulin hypoglycaemia. Caution should, therefore, be exercised in administering beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and insulin together. A reduction in the dose of insulin may be necessary.</td></tr></table></div>
<div class='ANTAGONIST'><table><tr><td>Effect of neurotransmitters on the in vitro release of immunoreactive thyrotropin-releasing hormone from rat mediobasal hypothalamus. The in vitro release of TRH from hypothalamic fragments or purified nerve endings (synaptosomes) has been evaluated after incubation for 10 min in the presence of various concentrations of K+ or neurotransmitters. Release of the hormone from fragments but not from synaptosomes was enhanced in the presence of 56 mM K+ in a Ca++ -dependent manner. Neurotransmitter effects were thus tested on the fragments. Addition of histamine (10 (-7)-10(-5) M) induced a significant increase over the basal release of TRH. A comparable effect was obtained with dimaprit (10(-5) M), a highly specific agonist of histamine <span class="CHEMICAL">H2</span> receptors; conversely, the response to histamine was blocked by the addition of a <span class="CHEMICAL">H2</span> (metiamide; 10(-6) M) but not of a <span class="GENE">H1</span> (mepyramine; 10(-6) M) antagonist to the incubation medium. Dopamine (10(-7) M) slightly inhibited the release of TRH, but antagonists of dopamine receptors (10(-7)-10(-6) M fluphenazine or 10(-6) M alpha-flupentixol) exhibited an inhibitory effect by themselves, so that specific receptors involved in mediating dopamine actions could not be further characterized. In contrast, noradrenalin, serotonin gamma-aminobutyric acid and acetylcholine (tested at concentration of 10(-7) M) did not alter the basal release of the tripeptide.</td></tr></table></div>

The inhibition of adenylate cyclase by norepinephrine is reversed by <span class="GENE">alpha receptor</span> antagonists such as dihydroergotamine or phentolamine, but not by the beta receptor antagonist <span class="CHEMICAL">propranolol</span>. The effect of norepinephrine on adenylate cyclase activity initially is dependent on GTP; half-maximal inhibition of enzyme activity by norepinephrine is obtained with 0.2 micron GTP.

Since bemegride and PTZ are convulsants at higher doses, the discriminative stimulus properties of these drugs might be based on a subtle convulsive brain state.

This amino acid was attached in thioether linkage at C-6. The SRS is structurally related to previously identified epoxy and dihydroxy metabolites of arachidonic acid in leukocytes. A common feature is the presence of a conjugated triene, and the name "leukotriene" has been introduced to designate these compounds. Leukotriene A (5,6-epoxy-7,9,11,14-icosatetraenoic acid) is an intermediate in the formation of leukotriene B (5,12-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-icosatetraenoic acid) and is proposed to be a precursor also of leukotriene C, which is the SRS identified here.</td></tr></table></div>

As with SRS-A, pSRS could be absorbed onto Amberlite XAD-2 and silicic acid.

The renal cortical factor in subthreshold concentration also potentiated responses of the rabbit aorta to <span class="CHEMICAL">angiotensin</span> and norepinephrine. The factor's intrinsic activity and ability to potentiate the smooth muscle actions of endogenous vasoconstrictors make it a candidate as a mediator of smooth muscle responses in a number of states.</td></tr></table></div>

The effect of D-amino acids was always much less than that of their corresponding L-isomers. There was no appreciable difference in the effectiveness of an alpha-amino acid (alpha-alanine) and beta-amino acid (beta-alanine). (b) The threshold concentrations of the most potent amino acids (arginine, glycine) were between 10(-8) and 10(-9) M.

(c) The palatine receptors responded sensitively to various carboxylic acid solutions whose pH was adjusted to neutral. The threshold concentrations varied between 10(-4) and 10(-7) M.

The cerebellar cGMP content increases after isoniazid; this response remains unchanged in rats pretreated with 3-AP. Since isoniazid decreases cerebellar gamma-aminobuturic acid (GABA) levels, the increase in cGMP content might reflect a reduction in the availability of GABA at the level of postsynaptic receptors. Apomorphine (a <span class="GENE">dopamine receptor</span> agonist) and haloperidol (a <span class="GENE">dopamine receptor</span> blocker) increase or decrease the cGMP content of cerebellar cortex, respectively. Neither drug changes the guanylate cyclase activity of cerebellar homogenates; moreover their action on cerebellar cGMP content persists after 3-AP. Chloropromazine, like haloperidol, decreases the cerebellar cGMP content. The increase in cerebellar cGMP content elicited by apomorphine can be differentiated from that elicited by <span class="CHEMICAL">harmaline</span> or isoniazid; presumably apomorphine indirectly activates mossy fibers. The decrease in cerebellar cGMP content elicited by haloperidol can be differentiated from that elicited by diazepam; perhaps haloperidol reduces the mossy fiber input to the cerebellum.

Compared to isoprenaline the <span class="CHEMICAL">beta 2</span>-selective agonist salbutamol was 4--6 times more potent as a vasodilator in the muscle than in adipose tissue. Furthermore two <span class="GENE">beta 1</span>-selective agonists (Tazolol and H80/62) caused vasodilatation in adipose tissue but not in the gracilis muscle. When given by close i.a. injection after beta-adrenoceptor blockade, adrenaline was a more potent vasoconstrictor than noradrenaline in both tissues. Before beta-blockade, however, noradrenaline was the more potent vasoconstrictor in the gracilis muscle whereas adrenaline was more potent in adipose tissue. Intravenous infusion of adrenaline in doses causing vasodilatation in the muscle caused vasoconstriction in adipose tissue whereas intravenous infusion of noradrenaline caused vasoconstriction in both tissues. The present findings suggest that the beta-adrenoceptors mediating vasodilatation in skeletal muscle are mainly ose tissue. Since adrenaline is a much more potent beta2- than beta1-agonist, these differences point to different roles of intravascular adrenaline in the two sites. In skeletal muscle circulating adrenaline is mainly a vasodilator whereas in subcutaneous adipose tissue it mainly acts as a vasoconstrictor.</td></tr></table></div>

The cardiovascular <span class="GENE">alpha adrenergic receptors</span> evoke vasoconstriction, the cardiovascular beta receptors evoke vasodilation and cardiac stimulation. All blood vessels have both alpha and beta receptors. In some areas, for example skin and kidney, the alpha receptors predominate. In some vascular beds, for example the nutrient vessels in skeletal muscle, beta receptors predominate. In other beds, such as coronary, visceral, and connective tissue both receptors are active. The cardiovascular effects of adrenergic agonists depend on which receptor they act on. Phenylephrine is specific for alpha receptors. Isoproterenol is specific for beta receptors. Epinephrine and norepinephrine act on both. The real value of knowing the receptor specificity of each agonist is that side effects can more easily be predicted.

<div class='AGONIST'><table><tr><td>Pharmacologically induced changes in the 3':5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate content of rat cerebellar cortex: difference between apomorphine, haloperidol and harmaline. Harmaline increases cerebellar 3':5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) content in a dose-related manner; this increase is prevented by a pretreatment with 3-acetylpyridine (3-AP) (0.66 mmol/kg) which destroys climbing fibers and inhibits harmaline-induced tremor. The cerebellar cGMP content increases after isoniazid; this response remains unchanged in rats pretreated with 3-AP. Since isoniazid decreases cerebellar gamma-aminobuturic acid (GABA) levels, the increase in cGMP content might reflect a reduction in the availability of GABA at the level of postsynaptic receptors. Apomorphine (a <span class="GENE">dopamine receptor</span> agonist) and haloperidol (a <span class="GENE">dopamine receptor</span> blocker) increase or decrease the cGMP content of cerebellar cortex, respectively. Neither drug changes the guanylate cyclase activity of cerebellar homogenates; moreover their action on cerebellar cGMP content persists after 3-AP. <span class="CHEMICAL">chloropromazine</span>, like haloperidol, decreases the cerebellar cGMP content. The increase in cerebellar cGMP content elicited by apomorphine can be differentiated from that elicited by harmaline or isoniazid; presumably apomorphine indirectly activates mossy fibers. The decrease in cerebellar cGMP content elicited by haloperidol can be differentiated from that elicited by diazepam; perhaps haloperidol reduces the mossy fiber input to the cerebellum. We suggest that the cGMP content of cerebellar cortex fluctuates in response to changes in the afferent stimulatory input to the cerebellum; it increases when the activity of either climbing or mossy fibers is increased; it decreases when either of these two stimulatory inputs is reduced.</td></tr></table></div>

In the presence of an antioxidant, ascorbic acid (6 X 10(-4)M), a significant dose-related stimulation of renin release was observed with addition of 10(-5)M and higher concentrations of dopamine. When the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, pheniprazine (1 X 10(-5)M) was added, significant, dose-related stimulation of renin release was observed with 10(-8)M and higher concentrations of dopamine. Dopamine-induced renin release was not inhibited by the presence of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, <span class="CHEMICAL">phentolamine</span> (9 X 10(-4)M), the dopaminergic antagonist, haloperidol (5 X 10(-5)M) or the neural uptake inhibitor, cocaine (1 X 10(-5)M).

These studies indicate that dopamine can directly stimulate renin release in the absence of effects of hemodynamic factors, alterations in sodium metabolism or release of endogenous adrenergic agents. Further, this direct effect of dopamine on renin release appears to be mediated by an agonistic effect on the <span class="GENE">juxtaglomerular beta receptor</span> rather than by the presence of a specific dopaminergic receptor for renin release.</td></tr></table></div>

The effect of D-amino acids was always much less than that of their corresponding L-isomers. There was no appreciable difference in the effectiveness of an alpha-amino acid (alpha-alanine) and beta-amino acid (beta-alanine). (b) The threshold concentrations of the most potent amino acids (arginine, glycine) were between 10(-8) and 10(-9) M. A linear relation between the magnitude of the response and log stimulus concentration held for a wide concentration range for all the amino acids examined. (c) The palatine receptors responded sensitively to various carboxylic acid solutions whose pH was adjusted to neutral. The threshold concentrations varied between 10(-4) and 10(-7) M. The magnitude of the response at 10(-2) M increased with an increase of carbon chain length. (d) The extent of cross-adaptation was examined with various combinations of amino acids. A variety of the response patterns showing complete cross-adaptation, no cross-adaptation, or synergetic interaction was observed. The synergetic interaction was also observed when one amino acid below its threshold concentration was added to the other amino acid below its threshold concentration was added to the other amino acid.

However, other antipsychotic agents (chlorpromazine, haloperidol and pimozide) did not inhibit raphe cell firing. The inhibitory potency of these drugs on raphe activity correlates with reported central noradrenergic blocking efficacy. An alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, piperoxane, but not the beta-blocking agents, propranolol and MJ 1999, inhibited raphe activity when administered systemically. All of these drugs appear to act indirectly since they (and NE) have relatively weak or variable effects when applied microiontophoretically to raphe neurons. The depressant effects of certain antipsychotic drugs and piperoxane on <span class="CHEMICAL">5HT</span> neurons appears to be mediated by a cnetral adrenergic system since (1) the depression could be reversed by the catecholamine releasing agents 1- and d-amphetamine; (2) the depression could be abolished by destruction of adrenergic pathways in the CNS by chemical, mechanical, or electrothermic lesions.

The dominantly alpha adrenergic agonist <span class="CHEMICAL">phenylephrine</span> (Sympathomim) had not any effect; the alpha blocker phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline) slightly depressed gastric evaluation.

A pretreatment by phenoxybenzamine of the animals did not affect epinephrine influence whereas a pretreatment by propranolol completely abolished the inhibitory effect of epinephrine on gastric motility.

The dose-response curve for the chronotropic action of phenylephrine was parallel to that of isoprenaline, whilst the dose-response curve for the inotropic action of phenylephrine was less steep than that of isoprenaline.3 The infusion of pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, at a rate of 1 mug/min, shifted the isoprenaline dose-response curves to the right, and to the same extent, in both papillary muscle and sinus node preparations. In contrast to isoprenaline, the antagonism of phenylephrine by pindolol was noncompetitive. Phentolamine did not affect the positive inotropic and chronotropic actions of phenylephrine.4 On isolated ventricular strips alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by 10(-6) M phentolamine did not affect dose-response curves to phenylephrine or dopamine. Pindolol shifted the dopamine dose-response curves to the right in a competitive manner and those of phenylephrine in a noncompetitive manner.5 On ventricular strips from reserpine-pretreated dogs phenylephrine and tyramine dose-response curves were shifted markedly to the right and downwards. Desipramine (10(-5) M) which enhanced the action of <span class="CHEMICAL">noradrenaline</span> considerably reduced the myocardial responses of phenylephrine.6 Papaverine (10(-5) M) decreased the threshold concentration of phenylephrine required to stimulate the myocardium and shifted phenylephrine dose-response curves to the left.7 Raising the temperature from 32 degrees C to 37 degrees C shifted phenylephrine dose-response curves to the right; when the temperature was raised from 37 degrees C to 42 degrees C the affinity of the drug was not changed.8 Other alpha-adrenoceptor stimulants, methoxamine and clonidine, decreased the active tension of ventricular strips.

In contrast to isoprenaline, the antagonism of <span class="CHEMICAL">phenylephrine</span> by pindolol was noncompetitive. Phentolamine did not affect the positive inotropic and chronotropic actions of phenylephrine.4 On isolated ventricular strips alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by 10(-6) M phentolamine did not affect dose-response curves to <span class="CHEMICAL">phenylephrine</span> or dopamine.

Desipramine (10(-5) M) which enhanced the action of noradrenaline considerably reduced the myocardial responses of phenylephrine.6 Papaverine (10(-5) M) decreased the threshold concentration of <span class="CHEMICAL">phenylephrine</span> required to stimulate the myocardium and shifted <span class="CHEMICAL">phenylephrine</span> dose-response curves to the left.7 Raising the temperature from 32 degrees C to 37 degrees C shifted <span class="CHEMICAL">phenylephrine</span> dose-response curves to the right; when the temperature was raised from 37 degrees C to 42 degrees C the affinity of the drug was not changed.8 Other alpha-adrenoceptor stimulants, methoxamine and clonidine, decreased the active tension of ventricular strips. The responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline (in the presence of pindolol; 3 x 10(-8) M) were not affected by phentolamine (10(-6) M).9 The results indicate that <span class="GENE">adrenoceptors</span> mediating positive inotropic responses in the dog ventricle are of the beta-type and that post-synaptic alpha-adrenoceptors are not involved. <span class="CHEMICAL">phenylephrine</span> acts mainly by releasing noradrenaline from adrenergic nerve endings and partly by a weak direct action on beta-adrenoceptors.</td></tr></table></div>

The stimulatory effect of noradrenaline and isoproterenol was blocked by propranolol (a beta-adrenergic blocker) but not by phentolamine (an alpha-adrenergic blocker). Pimozide (a selective dopaminergic antagonist) inhibited the increase of cyclic AMP formation induced by dopamine or apomorphine but not that induced by noradrenaline, isoproterenol, or serotonin. Neither propranolol or phentolamine had any effect on dopamine- or serotonin-stimulated cyclic AMP formation. Chlorpromazine blocked the increase of cyclic AMP formation induced by noradrenaline, dopamine or serotonin, while cyproheptadine, a putative central serotonergic antagonist, was ineffective.

Each of these substances may on different specific neurons elicit at least three types of response, caused by a fast depolarizing Na+, a fast hyperpolarizing Cl-, or a slow hyperpolarizing K+ conductance increase.

Isolated flagellar apparatus could be induced to change from forward to reverse motion in vitro by manipulation of exogenous calcium ions. The 2 types of motion were directly comparable to recorded responses of living <span class="GENE">cells</span>. Forward swimming occurred at levels of calcium below 10(-6)M, the isolated apparatus changing to backward motion above this level. Motility was inhibited at concentrations above 10(-3)M. The threshold for reversal of motion by calcium was lowered to 10(-7)M when the flagellar membranes were solubilized with detergent, indicating that the flagellar membranes are involved in the regulaion of the level of calcium within the axoneme. The reversal of motion by calcium was itself freely reversible. The relationship of these observations to the known tactic responses of Chlamydomonas is discussed.</td></tr></table></div>

Furthermore two <span class="GENE">beta 1</span>-selective agonists (Tazolol and H80/62) caused vasodilatation in adipose tissue but not in the gracilis muscle.

The present findings suggest that the beta-adrenoceptors mediating vasodilatation in skeletal muscle are mainly ose tissue.

The cerebellar cGMP content increases after isoniazid; this response remains unchanged in rats pretreated with 3-AP. Since <span class="CHEMICAL">isoniazid</span> decreases cerebellar gamma-aminobuturic acid (GABA) levels, the increase in cGMP content might reflect a reduction in the availability of GABA at the level of postsynaptic receptors.

The increase in cerebellar cGMP content elicited by apomorphine can be differentiated from that elicited by harmaline or isoniazid; presumably apomorphine indirectly activates mossy fibers. The decrease in cerebellar cGMP content elicited by haloperidol can be differentiated from that elicited by diazepam; perhaps haloperidol reduces the mossy fiber input to the cerebellum.

The dose-response curve for the chronotropic action of phenylephrine was parallel to that of isoprenaline, whilst the dose-response curve for the inotropic action of phenylephrine was less steep than that of isoprenaline.3 The infusion of pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, at a rate of 1 mug/min, shifted the isoprenaline dose-response curves to the right, and to the same extent, in both papillary muscle and sinus node preparations. In contrast to isoprenaline, the antagonism of phenylephrine by pindolol was noncompetitive. Phentolamine did not affect the positive inotropic and chronotropic actions of phenylephrine.4 On isolated ventricular strips alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by 10(-6) M phentolamine did not affect dose-response curves to phenylephrine or dopamine. Pindolol shifted the dopamine dose-response curves to the right in a competitive manner and those of phenylephrine in a noncompetitive manner.5 On ventricular strips from reserpine-pretreated dogs phenylephrine and tyramine dose-response curves were shifted markedly to the right and downwards. Desipramine (10(-5) M) which enhanced the action of noradrenaline considerably reduced the myocardial responses of phenylephrine.6 Papaverine (10(-5) M) decreased the threshold concentration of phenylephrine required to stimulate the myocardium and shifted phenylephrine dose-response curves to the left.7 Raising the temperature from 32 degrees C to 37 degrees C shifted phenylephrine dose-response curves to the right; when the temperature was raised from 37 degrees C to 42 degrees C the affinity of the drug was not changed.8 Other alpha-adrenoceptor stimulants, methoxamine and clonidine, decreased the active tension of ventricular strips. The responses to noradrenaline and <span class="CHEMICAL">adrenaline</span> (in the presence of pindolol; 3 x 10(-8) M) were not affected by phentolamine (10(-6) M).9 The results indicate that <span class="GENE">adrenoceptors</span> mediating positive inotropic responses in the dog ventricle are of the beta-type and that post-synaptic alpha-adrenoceptors are not involved.

Iontophoretic glutamate potentials were also reduced.

These effects were largely unchanged in a low C1- bathing solution. Procaine (1 mM) decreased membrane conductance and did not affect responses to <span class="CHEMICAL">GABA</span> or glutamate. 4 The H2-antagonist burimamide blocked both glutamate and GABA-evoked responses on the lobster muscle without affecting resting potential or conductance. 5 In the frog cord, bath-applied histamine produced ventral root depolarizations and dorsal root hyperpolarizations (sometimes biphasic responses). These effects were reduced by tetrodotoxin (TTX) but not by antazoline (H1-blocker) or burimamide; the latter reversibly antagonized responses to both glutamate and <span class="CHEMICAL">GABA</span> on TTX-treated cords while antazoline was ineffective. 6 It is suggested that antihistamines can act as non-specific amino acid antagonists by interacting at the level of the receptor-coupled ionophores.</td></tr></table></div>

In the ileum, responses to acetylcholine were increased in the presence of DFP, edrophonium and physostigmine but were unaffected by iso-Ompa. responses to <span class="CHEMICAL">carbachol</span> were not increased by any of the anticholinesterases. HC-3 (2.8 X 10(-4) M) inhibited responses to both acetylcholine and <span class="CHEMICAL">carbachol</span> in the ileum and the degree of inhibition was not significantly altered by the presence of any of the anticholinesterases used. Although a weak anticholinesterase, HC-3 was also found to decrease the inhibitory action of physostigmine on the hydrolysis of acetylcholine by homogenates of rat ileum. A similar effect was noted with DFP but not with edrophonium. The results obtained do not support a prejunctional action for HC-3 in antagonizing responses to <span class="CHEMICAL">carbachol</span>.

Intravenous infusion of adrenaline in doses causing vasodilatation in the muscle caused vasoconstriction in adipose tissue whereas intravenous infusion of noradrenaline caused vasoconstriction in both tissues. The present findings suggest that the beta-adrenoceptors mediating vasodilatation in skeletal muscle are mainly ose tissue. Since adrenaline is a much more potent beta2- than beta1-agonist, these differences point to different roles of intravascular adrenaline in the two sites.

On the other hand, intrastriatal kainic acid injection caused no change in the steady-state concentration of cyclic AMP in striatal slices, or in the in vivo cyclic AMP content in the striatum of rats killed by microwave irradiation. Receptor-mediated increases in cyclic AMP accumulation in striatal slices were either unchanged or markedly potentiated by kainic acid treatment.

Furthermore two <span class="GENE">beta 1</span>-selective agonists (Tazolol and H80/62) caused vasodilatation in adipose tissue but not in the gracilis muscle. When given by close i.a. injection after beta-adrenoceptor blockade, adrenaline was a more potent vasoconstrictor than noradrenaline in both tissues. Before beta-blockade, however, noradrenaline was the more potent vasoconstrictor in the gracilis muscle whereas adrenaline was more potent in adipose tissue. Intravenous infusion of adrenaline in doses causing vasodilatation in the muscle caused vasoconstriction in adipose tissue whereas intravenous infusion of noradrenaline caused vasoconstriction in both tissues. The present findings suggest that the beta-adrenoceptors mediating vasodilatation in skeletal muscle are mainly ose tissue. Since adrenaline is a much more potent beta2- than beta1-agonist, these differences point to different roles of intravascular adrenaline in the two sites.
